#### Bell Instability and Cosmic-Ray Acceleration in AGN Ultrafast Outflow Shocks

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid (NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at reverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\!\lesssim\!10^{-4}\,\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-3}\,\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.
#### Radiation Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of sub-Eddington Circumbinary Disk in a 10:1 Massive Black Hole Binary

 - **Abstract**
 We present a global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation of a circumbinary disk (CBD) around a massive black hole binary (MBHB) with a total mass $2 \times 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ and mass ratio $0.1$, separated by $100\, GM_{\rm tot}/c^2$. The inclusion of radiation makes the disk thinner, denser, less eccentric at the inner edge, and more filamentary when compared to an otherwise identical locally isothermal MHD disk. The RMHD disk has accretion rate $\sim 0.23\,\dot{M}_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ and produces thermal emission peaking in the near-UV/optical with a luminosity of $\sim 1\, \% L_{\rm {Edd }}$. Compared with an equal-mass binary with the same total mass, the thermal emission of the CBD around the unequal-mass binary is several orders of magnitude brighter and much more variable at far-UV/soft X-rays frequencies. Similarly, we find that the light curve associated with the $0.1$ mass ratio binary exhibits dominant periodicity corresponding to 2 binary orbits, compared to the equal-mass binary that shows periodicity at 2.5-5 binary orbits. Our results highlight the importance of radiation for the structure and observational properties of MBHB circumbinary disks and have implications for detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational wave precursors and for the heavier binaries targeted by the Pulsar Timing Arrays.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulation-based inference (SBI) is emerging as a new statistical paradigm for addressing complex scientific inference problems. By leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for sequential SBI.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) Streamers are newly identified channels that transport mass from large, molecular-cloud scales down to small, protoplanetary-disk scales. To better understand their impact on planet formation, it is essential to study their physical and chemical properties. In this framework, we aim to characterize the longest streamer identified in carbon chain emission within the Class I system L1489 IRS, connecting the nearby prestellar core L1489 to the young stellar object (YSO). We observed multiple transitions of C$_2$H, ortho-c-C$_3$H$_2$, and HC$_3$N in L1489 IRS with NOEMA and IRAM-30m at 3mm and 2mm. Using a variety of radiative transfer methods, including a hyperfine structure (HFS) fitting, rotational diagrams, and proposing a new self-consistent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach combined with the non-LTE RADEX code, we derived the column densities and abundances of those molecules, as well as the H$_2$ number density along the streamer. This enabled us to estimate its mass, infall rate, and its impact on the {star+disk} system's mass. We found lower limits on the streamer mass of $\geq(4.67-18.3)\times10^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ (i.e., $\geq0.65-2.57$ times the current disk mass) and an infall rate of $\geq(1.94-7.57)\times10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, where the ranges correspond to the different molecular tracers. These values are consistent with those derived in similar Class I objects. This suggests that the disk could be fully replenished by streamer material. Given its mass, the streamer is likely at the origin of the external warped disk seen in this system, as predicted by numerical simulations. Moreover, the first investigations based on the C$_2$H/c-C$_3$H$_2$ and HC$_3$N/c-C$_3$H$_2$ abundance ratios suggest that the streamer chemistry may be inherited from the core. These results suggest, for the first time, that the chemical composition of a Class I object is [...]

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetism is thought to play an important role in the evolution and dynamics of stars, though little is known about magnetic fields deep within stellar interiors. A promising avenue for probing these fields uses asteroseismic observations of global oscillations that result from the coupling of acoustic waves in the convective zone to internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the radiative interior. Recent modeling efforts implicate deep magnetic fields in the suppression of dipole mixed modes observed in 20% of red giants and a number of high-mass main sequence stars. Previous numerical and theoretical work shows that core magnetic fields could suppress axisymmetric global modes by refracting down-going IGWs into slow-magnetosonic (SM) waves that damp at magnetic cutoff heights. Here, we extend these results to the non-axisymmetric case, for which the IGWs and SM waves are coupled to a continuous spectrum of Alfven waves (AWs). We consider a Cartesian model of the radiative interior with uniform stratification and a spatially-varying, current-free magnetic field. Using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation to solve for the vertical mode structure, corroborated with numerical simulations, we show that IGWs convert to up-going SM waves, which resonate with the Alfven spectrum and produce mixed SM-AW modes. We find cutoff heights (as in the axisymmetric case), above which the SM/SM-AWs convert to AWs. Latitudinal variations of the background magnetic field lead to phase mixing of the AWs, resulting in rapid damping. Our results suggest that energy in both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric IGWs is lost via interactions with a strong magnetic field.
#### Investigating Nonlinear Landau Damping in Hybrid Simulations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14031

 - **Abstract**
 Phenomenological studies of cosmic-ray self-confinement often hinge on the linear theory for the growth rate of the streaming instability and for the damping rate of the generated magnetic modes. Largely different expressions exist, especially for the rate of nonlinear Landau damping, which is often assumed to be the most important damping mechanism in warm ionized plasmas. Using hybrid-PIC simulations in the resonant streaming instability regime, we present a comprehensive assessment of nonlinear Landau damping and show that the damping rate at a given scale depends on the power in magnetic fields on larger scales. Furthermore, we find that an inverse cascade develops, which produces magnetic fields on scales larger than the resonant ones. Here we extend previous results obtained for a mono-energetic distribution of non-thermal particles to the case of broader CR distributions, as a first step towards developing phenomenological models. Pre-existing turbulence of Alfvénic nature at large scales severely affects the damping of waves produced by low-energy CRs; depending on its amplitude, such a turbulence may inhibit the growth of streaming instability so that CRs are either self-confined at all energies or not at all.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-relativistic plasma outflows are intrinsically connected with gamma-ray bursts. Over the years, a large number of analytical and numerical works has been devoted to understanding the intricacies of their complex dynamics, with most of these past studies performed in the ideal MHD regime. We propose a self-similar formalism, based on the expansion of the equations of resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for the description of these outflows in the vicinity of their symmetry axis and present semi-analytical solutions describing strongly relativistic jets in both the ideal and resistive MHD regimes. Our solutions provide a clear picture of the impact of electromagnetic dissipation on the acceleration and collimation mechanisms which determine the kinetic and morphological characteristics of these relativistic outflows. The resistive MHD solutions are compared to their ideal MHD counterparts, revealing the key differences between the two regimes. Our comparative analysis sheds light on the possible role of electromagnetic dissipation in shaping the dynamics of the ultra-relativistic outflows associated with gamma-ray bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolved cosmological matter density field is fully determined by the initial matter density field at fixed cosmological parameters. However, the two-dimensional cosmological projected matter density field, relevant for weak-lensing and photometric galaxy studies, is fully determined by the initial projected matter density field only at the linear order. At non-linear order, the entire volume of initial matter contributes. We study a model for the evolved projected density field that is deterministic in the initial projected density fields and probabilistic in the effects of the remaining modes in the initial conditions. We write down predictions for the mean evolved projected field model using Lagrangian perturbation theory. We run a suite of small N-body simulations with fixed projected initial conditions and measure the statistical properties of the ensemble of evolved projected fields. Measurements and theory are in good agreement and show that the information on the initial projected fields is exponentially suppresses on non-linear scales. Our model offers a potential approach to a field-level likelihood of projected fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Gyrochronology, a method for dating aged field stars ($\gtrsim$ a few Gyr) based on their rotation rate, has recently been shown to fail for many stars older than the sun. The explanation most often put forth is that a shutdown or mode change in the stellar dynamo leads to a sharp decrease in angular momentum loss in magnetized coronal winds. In this paper, we explore an alternate possibility, namely a collapse of the wind itself through a reduction of coronal heating. We show that in the low coronal temperature ($T_0$) limit, even at solar-like low rotation rates ($\Omega$) and coronal magnetic field strength ($B_{r0}$), magnetocentrifugal effects are important and preclude expression of the mass and angular momentum loss rates as power-laws of $T_0$ or $\Omega$ when $T_0$ drops below $\simeq 1.5\,$MK. Mass loss is found to scale linearly with power input into the wind at all coronal temperatures. Introducing an ad hoc power law relationship $T_0\propto B_{r0}^\sigma$ while retaining the ``standard'' dynamo relationship $B_{r0}\propto\Omega$, we show that reproducing the observed break in gyrochronology requires an exponent $\sigma\gtrsim 1.5$, with which is associated a drop by over 3 orders of magnitude in power input into the quiet corona. This appears physically unrealistic, given current observations of chromospheric and coronal non-thermal emission in aged solar-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Several radio telescopes have been planned or proposed to be deployed on the Lunar farside in the coming years. These will observe the unexplored ultra-long wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum from the lunar farside's unique radio-quiet and ionosphere-free environment. One such lunar radio array is the NASA-funded concept - the Farside Array for Radio Science Investigations of the Dark Ages and Exoplanets (FARSIDE). FARSIDE will operate over 100~kHz to 40~MHz with 128 spatially non-co-located orthogonal pairs of antenna nodes distributed over a 12 X 12 km area in a four-arm spiral configuration. Being on the lunar farside, this radio interferometer will be deployed by tele-operated rovers. The rover deployment mode could lead to a phase offset between each of the two orthogonally polarised antenna elements in the array, which are typically co-located. In this paper, we quantify the effects of such antenna phase offsets on the polarisation response and imaging performance of the lunar radio array. Modelling and analysing the FARSIDE dipole beams with and without offset, we find the latter leads to additional leakages into Stokes U and V corresponding to Muller matrix terms of M2(0,1,2,3) and M3(0,1,2,3). Using a custom simulation pipeline to incorporate all four Stokes beams of spatially co-located and non-co-located dipoles, we produce visibilities and simulated images for the GLEAM (GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA) sky model through the FARSIDE array. We find that for a pure Stokes I input sky, the output image maximum Stokes V/I flux ratio for the offset case has increased to 2.5% versus 0.05% for the co-located case. The additional Stokes V needs to be corrected since the detection of Electron Cyclotron Maser (ECM) emissions from exoplanets requires high-fidelity Stokes V measurements.
#### Estimation of gravitational wave from solar emerging magnetic flux tube

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the gravitational waves (GWs) generated by the emergence of magnetic flux tubes in the solar convection zone. We focus on the upward buoyancy of magnetic flux tubes, which leads to significant magnetic activity and the formation of active region sunspots. This study adopts parameters representative of a moderate-sized solar active region to estimate the GWs generated by the emergence of magnetic flux tubes. Our results indicate that the GW strain amplitude, achievable through signal superposition and detection at close proximity (e.g., approximately one solar radius from the solar surface), may reach $\sim$10$^{-29}$. The characteristic GW frequency is estimated at $\sim$10$^{-5}$ Hz, placing it at the high-frequency end of the sensitivity band of Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) methods. However, the estimated strain amplitudes remain orders of magnitude below the sensitivity thresholds of current and foreseeable gravitational wave detectors. Notably, reducing the cadence $\Delta t$ of Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations to approximately 2 hours ($\Delta t = 2\text{hours}$) would raise the maximum detectable frequency to about $5.8 \times 10^{-5} \text{Hz}$, thereby encompassing the dominant spectral component of solar activity-related GWs predicted in this study, offering a potential pathway for future detection. Successful detection in the future may help to predict the super solar active region emergence in space weather forecasting.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust plays a critical role in the study of the interstellar medium (ISM). Extinction maps derived from optical surveys often fail to capture regions with high column density due to the limited photometric depth in optical wavelengths. To address these limitations, we developed the XPNICER method based on near-infrared (NIR) photometric survey data. This method combines the previously established PNICER and Xpercentile techniques, enabling effective mitigation of foreground contamination and improved handling of complex dust structures in the Galactic plane, which thus can provide more accurate extinction estimates, particularly in highly obscured regions. By applying XPNICER to the Galactic Plane Survey from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey, we have generated a series of two-dimensional (2D) dust extinction maps that span roughly 1800 deg2 of the Galactic plane (0< l < 110deg and 140< l < 232deg, |b| < 5deg). These maps, with spatial resolutions between 30arcsec and 300arcsec, can trace extinction up to Av ~ 30-40 mag. This new approach offers higher spatial resolution and better detection of high-extinction regions compared to previous large-scale dust-based maps of the Galactic plane, providing an independent and complementary measure of dust column densities.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection is a multiscale phenomenon where fluid- and particle-scale processes interact. The particle-in-cell (PIC) method, capable of resolving kinetic (particle-scale) physics, is extensively used to study the kinetic effects in magnetic reconnection. Meanwhile, because of the high computational cost, PIC simulations cannot capture the interaction between kinetic and fluid dynamics, which poses a major obstacle to understanding magnetic reconnection in large-scale phenomena such as solar flares. A multi-hierarchy simulation that combines Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and PIC provides a promising means to overcome these spatial and temporal scale gaps. We developed a multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY (Kinetic And Magnetohydrodynamic MUlti-hierarchY simulation code), in which an ideal MHD simulation for a large domain and a PIC simulation for a smaller domain are solved in parallel with mutual information exchange. To validate the code, we conducted test simulations of MHD wave propagation and the shock tube problem. The results demonstrate that short-wavelength, high-frequency waves generated in the PIC region do not propagate into the MHD region, whereas MHD-scale structures propagate smoothly into the PIC region, highlighting the capability of our code for numerical studies of magnetic reconnection. By applying the KAMMUY code to magnetic reconnection while varying the PIC domain size, we find that the reconnection rate remains unchanged, regardless of the extent of the PIC region where the Hall magnetic field is present. It suggests that the spatial extension of the Hall magnetic field on the scale of $10 \sim 100 \lambda_i$ does not influence the reconnection rate.
#### Local Particle Acceleration in an ICME-in-Sheath Structure Observed by Solar Orbiter

 - **Abstract**
 Local particle acceleration in the shock sheath region formed during the interaction between multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is a complicated process that is still under investigation. On March 23, 2024, the successive eruption of two magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) from the solar active region 3614 produced twin CMEs, as identified in coronagraph images. By analyzing in-situ data from Solar Orbiter and Wind, it is found that the primary ICME-driven shock overtook the preceding ICME, trapping it in the sheath between the shock and the primary ICME, forming the ICME-in-sheath (IIS) structure. Using Solar Orbiter observations, we show that both electrons and ions are accelerated within the IIS. A clear enhancement of suprathermal electrons was observed at the IIS boundary, where strong flow shear and large magnetic field variation suggest possible local electron acceleration. Electrons (>38 keV) exhibit a long-lasting enhancement in the IIS with a spectral index of ~2.2, similar to that in the shock sheath and the primary ICME, indicating a similar solar origin. Inside both the sheath and IIS, spectra of proton and 4He are generally consistent with the prediction of the diffusive shock acceleration, whereas Fe and O present a double power-law shape. Additionally, the Fe/O ratio in the IIS is higher than that in the sheath, and more close to the abundance of the flare-related particles, suggesting the remnant particles of flare confined in the IIS.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric study of the intermediate polar (IP) 1RXS J080114.6-462324, using observations from the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) 1.0-m and 1.9-m telescopes and the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), complemented by archival TESS photometry. Photometric and photo-polarimetric data reveal a coherent modulation at the white dwarf (WD) spin period. TESS confirms periodicities of 1307.517 s (spin) and 11.803 h (orbital). Photopolarimetric and circular spectropolarimetric measurements show circular polarisation reaching ~+5%, modulated with the WD spin period, consistent with cyclotron emission from an accreting magnetic pole. Time-resolved optical spectra display prominent Balmer (H$\gamma$, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$) and He\textsc{ii} $\lambda$4686 emission features and additional He\textsc{i} emissions, all exhibiting minimal radial-velocity variations. We detect red-shifted absorption dips adjacent to the He\textsc{ii} and H$\beta$ lines, modulated at the WD spin period; periodogram analysis of the emission lines also yields spin modulation. These observations indicate that the system is a disc-fed, low-inclination IP. The combination of circular polarisation and spin-modulated absorption by infalling accretion curtain material supports this classification. Its comparatively long orbital period among IPs and the detection of polarised emission render 1RXS J080114.6-462324 an appealing candidate for evolutionary studies, potentially offering insight into how magnetic accretion systems evolve toward synchronism at longer orbital periods.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: Studying the dynamical evolution of young clusters is crucial for a more general understanding of the star formation process. Methods: We took spectra of >600 candidate pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in several nearby young clusters (NGC 2264 N & S, Collinder 95, and Collinder 359) using MMT/Hectospec. These spectra were analyzed for H{\alpha} emission and lithium absorption, features indicative of low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) still in their PMS evolution. We complemented these samples with YSOs identified via Gaia DR3 variability. In conjunction with Gaia astrometry, these data enable an analysis of cluster structure, kinematics and ages. In particular, we searched for halos of YSOs around our targets to test models of young cluster dynamical evolution. Results: For the NGC 2264 N & S cluster pair we identified 354 YSOs, while for Collinder 95 and 359 we identified 130 and 7 YSOs, respectively. We calculate kinematic "traceback ages" for YSOs in these clusters, which we compare to isochronal ages estimated using several sets of stellar evolution models. We find for NGC 2264 N & S that kinematic ages are generally smaller than their isochronal ages, which may indicate these systems remained bound for a few Myr before their current state of expansion. On the other hand, kinematic ages for Collinder 95 are often significantly larger than isochronal ages, which implies many of these YSOs did not originate from a central, dense region, leading to overestimated kinematic ages. Conclusions: We conclude that NGC 2264 N & S clusters likely formed as initially bound and compact systems, but have been gradually evaporating as cluster members become unbound, forming halos of unbound YSOs surrounding the cluster cores. We conclude that Collinder 95 likely formed initially sparse and substructured and has been dispersing since gas expulsion.

 - **Abstract**
 Through three-dimensional MHD simulations, we have uncovered a kind of fast coronal wave originating from both ends of a current sheet (CS) during a solar eruption. These waves are observed to appear near the top and bottom ends of the reconnection-related CS. The simulations demonstrate the presence of termination shock regions above the two ends of the CS. As the reconnection outflows escape from the vertical CS and encounter these termination shocks, they undergo partial reflection, redirecting towards the CS terminal fork walls. The identified waves propagate rapidly at a speed of approximately 1400 km/s with a period of just 2 s. Concurrently, the time-evolution of intensity within a small region of the CS terminal fork structures, exhibits a similar oscillation period of 2 s. All these evidence supports the notion that these QFP (Quasi-periodic Fast-Propagating) waves were excited by tuning fork effects within the CS system. Essentially, the rapid reconnection outflows are reflected by the terminal shocks, striking the fork walls at the CS ends. Moreover, parts of the oscillations along the tuning fork handle are transformed into thermal energy, accumulating in the CS center and elevating the temperature. This is the first time to report such QFP waves resulting from tuning fork effects within the CS during a solar eruption. These waves are anticipated to manifest closely following the propagation of CMEs and adjacent to the related post-flare loops in observations, with partial confirmation in current observations.

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarfs have long been prime targets in the search for habitable exoplanets, owing to their abundance in the galaxy and the relative ease of detecting Earth-sized worlds within their narrower habitable zones. Yet, these low-mass stars can emit high-energy radiation that may gradually erode planetary atmospheres, raising concerns about long-term habitability. TOI-700, a relatively quiescent M dwarf that hosts four known planets, stands out due to its Earth-sized TOI-700 d in the star's habitable zone. Here, we assess whether a habitable environment can be sustained on TOI-700 d by analyzing different UV flux levels and atmospheric pressures. We focus on two atmospheric scenarios - one analogous to the Archean Earth and another representing a modern Earth-like environment - using a 1D photochemistry-climate model. Our results indicate that all simulated cases can maintain temperatures compatible with liquid water on the surface. However, the dominant photochemical pathways differ substantially with UV levels: under low-UV conditions, haze formation in the Archean-like atmosphere provides the main UV shielding, whereas under intensified UV, ozone production in the modern-like atmospheres can protect the surface from harmful doses. Interestingly, although haze can impede the detection of certain biosignatures, such as CH4, CO2 and O2, it also enhances the overall atmospheric signal by increasing scattering and transit depth, potentially aiding in revealing the presence of an atmosphere. These findings underscore the dual role of hazes as both a challenge for biosignature detection and a potential protection of surface habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 Low- to intermediate-mass ($\sim$0.8$-$8 M$_\odot$) evolved stars contribute significantly to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium in the local Universe, making accurate mass-return estimates in their final stages crucial. The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS) is a large multi-telescope project targeting a volume-limited sample of $\sim$850 stars within 3 kpc in order to derive the dust and gas return rates in the Solar Neighbourhood, and to constrain the physics underlying these processes. We present an initial analysis of the CO-line observations, including detection statistics, carbon isotopic ratios, initial mass-loss rates, and gas-to-dust ratios. We describe a new data reduction pipeline to analyse the available NESS CO data from the JCMT, measuring line parameters and calculating empirical gas mass-loss rates. We present the first release of the available data on 485 sources, one of the largest homogeneous samples of CO data to date. Comparison with a large literature sample finds that high mass-loss rate and especially carbon-rich sources are over-represented in literature, while NESS is probing significantly more sources at low mass-loss rates, detecting 59 sources in CO for the first time and providing useful upper limits. CO line detection rates are 81% for the CO (2--1) line and 75% for CO (3--2). The majority (82%) of detected lines conform to the expected soft parabola shape, while eleven sources show a double wind. Calculated mass-loss rates show power-law relations with both the dust-production rates and expansion velocities up to $\sim 5 \times 10^{-6}$~\msunyr. Median gas-to-dust ratios of 250 and 680 are found for oxygen-rich and carbon-rich sources, respectively. Our analysis of CO observations in this first data release highlights the importance of our volume-limited approach in characterizing the local AGB population as a whole.
#### Exploring a cosmic ray inverse-Compton origin to the SZ-to-X-ray pressure deficit in the cool core cluster ZwCl 3146

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the possibility that inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by $\sim$GeV cosmic rays (CRs) injected by the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in cool core (CC) clusters produces a non-negligible continuum-like X-ray signal that is easily misinterpreted as intracluster medium (ICM) thermal bremsstrahlung continuum. This is particularly relevant to the cooling flow problem--the lack of star formation relative to X-ray-inferred ICM cooling rates. Using ZwCl 3146, a relaxed CC system at $z = 0.291$, we compare pressure profiles derived via X-rays and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. While SZ measurements probe only thermal ICM electrons, additional CR-IC emission would appear to boost the X-ray-inferred pressure. Relative to unity, we measure a $\simeq30\%$ decrement in $P_{SZ}/P_X$ within 100 kpc of the ZwCl 3146 center at a statistical significance of $\simeq 3.3\sigma$, consistent with predicted deficits from CR-IC contamination in reasonable models of central AGN-driven CR injection. X-ray spectral fits of a two-component model with thermal ICM and CR-IC emission are consistent with CR-IC as the cause of this deficit. We test alternative explanations and systematics that could drive such a decrement, with the leading order systematics associated with halo triaxiality. Collectively, these systematics are unlikely to produce a $P_{SZ}/P_X$ decrement $\gtrsim10\%$. While our results establish that non-negligible CR-IC emission is plausible in ZwCl 3146, we stress that more detailed studies of larger cluster samples are required to robustly assess whether CR-IC is relevant to the cooling flow problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic outflows are a key agent of galaxy evolution, yet their observed multiphase nature remains difficult to reconcile with theoretical models, which often fail to explain how cold gas survives interactions with hot, fast winds. We present high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic simulations of hot outflows interacting with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), parameterised by its cold-gas volume filling fraction $f_v$, depth $L_{\rm ISM}$, and clump size $r_{\rm cl}$. We identify a universal survival criterion $f_v L_{\rm ISM} \gtrsim r_{\rm crit}$ that generalises the classical single-cloud condition ($r_{\rm cl} > r_{\rm crit}$) and correctly predicts cold-gas survival across diverse ISM configurations - including scale-free - down to $r_{\rm cl}/r_{\rm crit} \sim 10^{-2}$. The surviving cold phase rapidly loses memory of the initial ISM structure and evolves toward a self-similar clump mass spectrum following Zipf's law ($\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}m \propto m^{-2}$), implying that turbulent mixing and radiative condensation universally shape multiphase outflows. Cold gas assembles into plumes or confined shells of size $\sim \chi r_{\mathrm{cl,min}}$, growing as mass is accreted from the hot phase. The interaction of a laminar wind with a clumpy ISM drives turbulence in both phases, with first-order velocity structure functions following a Kolmogorov scaling and an injection scale set by $L_{\rm ISM}$, while velocity dispersions reach $\sigma \sim c_{\rm s,cold}$. The areal covering fraction of cold gas approaches unity even for $f_v \sim 10^{-3}$, though its volume filling fraction stays low, explaining the "misty" appearance of observed outflows. Together, these results link small-scale cloud-wind interactions to galaxy-scale feedback, and we discuss their implications for interpreting observations and for modelling multiphase galactic winds in larger-scale simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The rich phenomenology of binary neutron star mergers offers a unique opportunity to test general relativity, investigate matter at supranuclear densities, and learn more about the origin of heavy elements. As multi-messenger sources, they emit both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across several frequency bands. The interpretation of these signals relies heavily on accurate numerical-relativity simulations that incorporate the relevant microphysical processes. Using the latest updates of the BAM code, we perform general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with two different spin configurations. We adopt a state-of-the-art equation of state based on relativistic mean-field theory developed for dense matter in neutron star mergers. To capture both dynamical ejecta and secular outflows from magnetic and neutrino-driven winds, we evolve the systems up to $\sim 100\ \rm ms$ after the merger at considerably high resolution with a grid spacing of $\Delta x \approx 93\ \rm m$ across the neutron stars. Our results show that the non-spinning configuration undergoes a more violent merger, producing more ejecta with lower electron fraction and higher velocities, while the spinning configuration forms a larger disk due to its higher angular momentum. Although the initial magnetic field amplification within $\lesssim 10\ \rm ms$ after merger is similar in both systems, the non-spinning system reaches stronger magnetic fields and higher energies at later times. For a detailed view of the multi-messenger observables, we extract the gravitational-wave signal and compute nucleosynthesis yields, the expected kilonova and afterglow light curves from our ejecta profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 The deuterium to hydrogen ratio in water ice in a planetary body carries important information on the history of water processing and delivery in the protostellar nebula. For a giant planet satellite, the D/H ratio is also affected by the processes and temperatures of the circumplanetary or circumstellar environment in which the satellites formed. Here we present robust JWST spectroscopic detections of the 4.14 $\mu$m O-D stretch absorption line (analogous to the 3 $\mu$m water O-H stretch) on the mid-sized Saturnian satellites and use these detections to infer a D/H ratio on each satellite. Within the limitations of the technique, we find that all of the satellites are consistent with having a D/H ratio of about $1.5 \times$ Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), which is about an order of magnitude higher than the value of the atmosphere of Saturn. A much higher previously reported D/H ratio for Phoebe is ruled out at the 10$\sigma$ level, and a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 2.3 $\times$ VSMOW is obtained. The elevated D/H ratios demonstrate that the solid planetesimals and pebbles that built the satellites never sublimed and re-equilibrated with the gaseous circumplanetary disk. The similarity of the D/H measurements across all satellites suggest that the D/H ratio of water ice in the vicinity of Saturn at the time of satellite formation was also approximately 1.5 $\times$ VSMOW.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have revealed a surprisingly large fraction of hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) interacting with dense confined circumstellar material (CSM), whose origin is heavily debated. Exploiting our recent implementation of a sophisticated radiation transport scheme in the moving-mesh code AREPO, we perform full-sphere 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of red supergiant envelopes. For $10\, M_\odot$ and $20\, M_\odot$ core-carbon-burning stars, we find that large-amplitude radial pulsations lift the surface material of density $10^{-14}$-$10^{-12}\; \mathrm{g\; cm^{-3}}$ to the circumstellar environment up to $3\times10^{14}$ cm, consistent with the inferred density for the interacting SN 2013fs. There, radiation acts on dust to drive highly anisotropic outflows of $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}\, M_\odot\, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The total CSM masses for both simulations are $\sim 0.01\, M_\odot$. Due to convection, the CSM density structure has order-of-magnitude angular variations, dominated by large-scale asymmetries. We suggest that (1) the CSM around the progenitor is bound material instead of a widely-assumed steady wind, (2) highly aspherical CSM is common and can be created by surface convection rather than only from binary interactions, and (3) 3D effects need to be incorporated in 1D SN modeling, potentially via effective clumping. Based on our simulations, we propose a 1D analytical CSM model to be directly used for SN observable modeling. We predict that progenitor pulsations (seen in SN 2023ixf) and highly-confined CSM (seen in SN 2013fs) should be common among most hydrogen-rich SNe. This can be tested with progenitor monitoring using Rubin Observatory and near-future high-cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT and UVEX.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm signal is a powerful probe of the early Universe's thermal history and could provide a unique avenue for constraining exotic physics. Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\sim 1~M_\odot-10^3~M_\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 230307A is one of the brightest long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) ever detected, yet its progenitor remains uncertain due to the variety of plausible astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we investigate four possible progenitors for GRB 230307A: a binary neutron star (BNS), a neutron star--white dwarf (NS--WD) system, a neutron star--black hole (NS--BH) merger, and a tidal disruption event (TDE) involving a white dwarf and a supermassive black hole. Additionally, we explore three distinct central engine models powering the kilonova associated with the BNS: radioactive decay of $r$-process nuclei in a two-component ejecta model, a magnetar-driven model including magnetic dipole spin-down, and a combined model of magnetar spin-down with ${}^{56}$Ni radioactive decay. We perform Bayesian multi-wavelength light-curve analyses using physically motivated models and priors, and evaluate model performance through Bayes factors and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores. Our results show a statistical preference for a BNS or NS--WD progenitor producing a kilonova powered by a magnetar and ${}^{56}$Ni decay, characterized by a ${}^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim4\times10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ and an ejecta mass of $0.06\,M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, under the assumption of a BNS origin within this model, we infer binary component masses of $m_{1} = 1.81^{+0.46}_{-0.61}\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_{2} = 1.61^{+0.65}_{-0.41}\,M_{\odot}$, with a dimensionless tidal deformability of $\tilde{\Lambda} = 471^{+318}_{-395}$. From the component mass posteriors, we infer that the observed offset can be explained by a natal kick as long as the systemic velocity is nearly aligned with the pre-kick orbital motion. In this case, the required kick velocity (co-moving frame) and binary separation range within $v'_{\mathrm{k}}\sim100$--$150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, and $a_0\sim2$--$3~R_{\odot}$, respectively.

 The Near InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) joined HARPS on the 3.6-m ESO telescope at La Silla Observatory in April 2023, dedicating part of its Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program to the radial velocity follow-up of TESS planet candidates to confirm and characterize transiting planets around M dwarfs. We report the first results of this program with the characterization of the TOI-756 system, which consists of TOI-756 b, a transiting sub-Neptune candidate detected by TESS, as well as TOI-756 c, an additional non-transiting planet discovered by NIRPS and HARPS. TOI-756 b is a 1.24-day period sub-Neptune with a radius of 2.81 $\pm$ 0.10 $R_\oplus$ and a mass of 9.8$^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$ $M_\oplus$. TOI-756 c is a cold eccentric (e$_c$ = 0.45 $\pm$ 0.01) giant planet orbiting with a period of 149.6 days around its star with a minimum mass of 4.05 $\pm$ 0.11 $M_\mathrm{jup}$. Additionally, a linear trend of 146$~\mathrm{m\,s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ is visible in the radial velocities, hinting at a third component, possibly in the planetary or brown dwarf regime. This system is unique in the exoplanet landscape, standing as the first confirmed example of such a planetary architecture around an M dwarf. With a density of 2.42 $\pm$ 0.49 g cm$^{-3}$, the inner planet, TOI-756 b, is a volatile-rich sub-Neptune. Assuming a pure H/He envelope, we inferred an atmospheric mass fraction of 0.023 and a core mass fraction of 0.27, which is well constrained by stellar refractory abundances derived from NIRPS spectra. It falls within the still poorly explored radius cliff and at the lower boundary of the Neptune desert, making it a prime target for a future atmospheric characterization with JWST to improve our understanding of this population.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic microquasar SS433 and the radio nebula W50 surrounding it present a prototypical example of a hyper-Eddington binary system shaping its ambient interstellar medium via energetic outflows. In this paper, we present X-ray observations of the SS433/W50 complex by the eROSITA telescope onboard the SRG space observatory. These data provide images of the entire nebula characterized by a very large dynamic range and allow spectral analysis of the diffuse X-ray emission. In particular, these data illustrate a close connection between the thermal and non-thermal components of W50 on scales ranging from sub-parsecs, represented by narrow X-ray bright filaments, to the entire extent $\gtrsim 100\,{\rm pc}$ of the nebula. These data also allow us to fully characterize a pair of nearly symmetric, sharp-edged, elongated structures aligned with the orbital axis of the binary system, which lack radio counterparts, but are prominent in very high energy gamma-ray emission. The resulting multifaceted picture of the interaction between energetic outflows and the surrounding medium paves the way for future focused multiwavelength observations and dedicated numerical simulations.
