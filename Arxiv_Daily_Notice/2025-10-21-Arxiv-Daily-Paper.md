 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the orbital eccentricity evolution of supermassive black hole binaries within galactic environments. We analyze the dynamics in triaxial merger remnants and subsequent interactions with geometrically thick nuclear discs. We confirm that gravitational torques in triaxial potentials efficiently extract angular momentum, resulting in binary formation with high initial eccentricities. We then analyze the binary-disc interaction using a 3D analytical framework incorporating the Airy formalism and potential softening. We present a self-consistent derivation demonstrating that the 3D suppression of high-order torques leads to distinct scalings with disc thickness ($h$): migration rates $\tau_a^{-1} \propto h^{-3}$ and eccentricity damping rates $\tau_e^{-1} \propto h^{-5}$. This establishes a timescale hierarchy, $\tau_e/\tau_a \propto h^2$. For typical parameters ($h\approx 0.2$), eccentricity damping is significantly faster than orbital decay ($\tau_e \approx 0.04 \, \tau_a$). We further develop a wavelet-based formalism to quantify the impact of disc inhomogeneities arising from accretion feedback and turbulence. We derive the stochastic torque variance in the wavelet domain and employ a Fokker-Planck analysis to determine the equilibrium eccentricity distribution. While stochastic fluctuations counteract deterministic damping, the strong damping imposed by the thick disc geometry ensures the equilibrium eccentricity remains small unless the fluctuations are highly non-linear. Hence, even if born highly eccentric, SMBHBs are rapidly circularized. This circularization trap forces binaries to approach the gravitational wave-dominated regime on nearly circular orbits, prolonging the total merger timescale. This introduces a substantial cosmological delay governed by stellar relaxation, which impacts detection rates and the modeling of SMBH assembly in cosmological frameworks.
#### Assessing the Distance for Probing the Nuclear Equation of State with Supernova Gravitational Waves

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae provide a unique probe of the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter. In this work, we focus on the bounce signal from numerical simulations of rotating supernovae and explore its potential for EOS inference. We employ a support vector machine, previously shown to perform best among tested methods, to classify GW signals simulated for 18 EOS models. For optimally oriented sources, we estimate that the Advanced LIGO A+ detector can probe the EOS for Galactic events, while third-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer can reach substantially farther. For randomly oriented sources, only these next-generation detectors are expected to have sufficient sensitivity. These results represent the potential observational range for probing the nuclear EOS, although, due to the simplifying assumptions adopted, they should be regarded as approximate upper limits.
#### Magnetohydrodynamic-guiding-center-particle-in-cell Method for Multiscale Plasma Kinetic Simulations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15156

 - **Abstract**
 We present the formulation, algorithm and numerical tests of the magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-cell (MHD-PIC) method with particles treated under the guiding center approximation, which we term the MHD-gPIC method, and it is implemented in the Athena++ MHD code. The new MHD-gPIC model consists of thermal (cold) fluid and high-energy particles whose dynamics are integrated through guiding center equations including drift motion, with carefully evaluated source terms as particle backreaction. The code is validated with a series of tests, and it is expected to be primarily applicable to study particle acceleration and transport in systems where gyro-resonance is considered insignificant. We also present preliminary studies of particle acceleration during non-relativistic magnetic reconnection.
#### Evidence for cloud-to-cloud variations in the ratio of polarized thermal dust emission to starlight polarization

 - **Abstract**
 The correlation between optical starlight polarization and polarized thermal dust emission can be used to infer intrinsic dust properties. This correlation is quantified by the ratio Rp/p, which has been measured to be 5.42 +/- 0.05 MJy sr^-1 at 353 GHz when averaged over large areas of the sky. We investigate this correlation using newly published stellar polarimetric data densely sampling a continuous sky region of ~4 square degrees at intermediate Galactic latitude. We combine RoboPol optical polarization measurements for 1,430 stars with submillimeter data from the Planck satellite at 353 GHz. We perform linear fits between the Planck (Qs, Us) and optical (qv, uv) Stokes parameters, accounting for the differences in resolution between the two datasets as well as the distribution of clouds along the line of sight. We find that in this region of the sky the Rp/p value is 3.67 +/- 0.05 MJy sr^-1, indicating a significantly shallower slope than that found previously using different stellar samples. We also find significant differences in the fitted slopes when fitting the Qs-qv and Us-uv data separately. We explore two explanations using mock data: miscalibration of polarization angle and variations in Rp/p along the line of sight due to multiple clouds. We show that the former can produce differences in the correlations of Qs-qv and Us-uv, but large miscalibration angles would be needed to reproduce the magnitude of the observed differences. Our simulations favor the interpretation that Rp/p differs between the two dominant clouds that overlap on the sky in this region. The difference in Rp/p suggests that the two clouds may have distinct dust polarimetric properties. With knowledge from the tomographic decomposition of the stellar polarization, we find that one cloud appears to dominate the correlation of Us-uv, while both clouds contribute to the correlation of the Qs-qv data.
#### A family of binaries with an extreme mass ratio

 - **Abstract**
 Multiplicity is ubiquitous among massive stars. While the stellar components usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars. We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature, rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong constraints for star formation models.
#### Extending TESS Flare Frequency Distributions with CHEOPS: power-law or lognormal?

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flares are intense bursts of radiation caused by magnetic reconnection events on active stars. They are especially frequent on M dwarfs, where they can strongly influence planetary habitability. Flare frequency distributions (FFDs) are usually modeled as power laws, but recent studies have proposed alternatives such as lognormal distributions, implying different flare mechanisms and planetary impacts. This work investigates which statistical distribution best describes flare occurrences on M dwarfs, considering both equivalent duration (ED), the quantity directly measured from photometry, and bolometric energy, which is more relevant for habitability assesments. We analyzed 110 M dwarfs observed with TESS and CHEOPS, detecting 5,620 flares. Complex events were decomposed, detection biases corrected, and FFDs from both missions scaled to build a combined distribution spanning nearly 10 orders of magnitude in bolometric energy. ED-based FFDs follow a power law, reflecting intrinsic photometric flare occurrence. However, bolometric energy-based FFDs deviate from a pure power law, being better described by a lognormal distribution or, more accurately, by a truncated power law with a break near $10^{33}$ erg, the typical superflare threshold. This truncation suggests a change in flare-generation physics between regular flares and superflares, with implications for the cumulative impact on exoplanetary atmospheres. The apparent low-energy flattening previously attributed to lognormal behavior arises from observational biases, while the drop in flare frequency above $10^{35}$ erg remains unexplained, possibly reflecting an intrinsic cutoff or current observational limits. The upcoming PLATO mission will be well suited to probe both regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Volcanism on Venus has never been directly observed, but several measurements indicate present-day activity. Volcanism could potentially play a role in climatic processes on Venus, especially in the sulfur cycle like on Earth. Observation of volcanic activity is the primary objective of future Venus spacecraft. However, there are many unknowns regarding its Venusian characteristics, like the condition at the vent, the volatile content and composition. Past modelling efforts have only studied explosive volcanic plume propagation over a limited range of flow parameters at the vent and in an idealised Venus atmospheric configuration. We propose to use the 1D FPLUME volcanic plume model in a realistic Venusian environment. In similar Venusian conditions, the height of the plume is consistent with past modelling. The present study shows that explosive volcanism would preferably reach 15 km of altitude. Under certain conditions, plumes are able to reach the VenSpec-H tropospheric altitude range of observations and even the 45 km cloud floor. For the first time, the impact of wind was quantified, and the super-rotating winds have a substantial impact by plume-bending of reducing the height of plumes. Contrary to the Earth, the atmospheric heat capacity depends greatly on temperature, and will disadvantage lower plumes and allow larger plumes to propagate at higher altitudes. The high latitude atmospheric environment, due to the thermal profile and weaker winds, is favorable to plumes reaching higher altitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cygnus OB2, in the Cygnus X complex -- one of the most active star-forming regions of the Galaxy -- hosts hundreds of O- and B-type stars at different evolutionary stages. This association provides a unique laboratory to study massive star evolution and dynamics. However, despite extensive studies, the absence of a fast-rotating group ($v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) among the O-type population of Cygnus OB2 challenges current models of massive star evolution. Aims. Stellar rotation strongly impacts spectral line shapes of O-type stars, and high rotation can potentially lead to misclassifications. We investigate whether some stars in Cygnus OB2, classified at low spectral resolution as B0, are actually rapidly rotating late-O types. Such cases could explain the observed lack of fast rotators in Cygnus OB2. Methods. Accounting for rotation, we reclassify the known B0 population in Cygnus OB2, using the MGB tool and both new and pre-existing optical spectroscopy. Finally, we compute projected rotational velocities using iacob-broad. Results. About $19\,\%$ of the initial B0 population in Cygnus OB2 are, in fact, late-O types. Only 6 stars in the entire dataset show $v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with just 1 new O-type star exceeding this threshold. Conclusions. In our study of Cygnus OB2, we continue to find a notable lack of fast rotators among its O-type population. We propose a combination of three factors as the most likely explanation: (i) the young age of Cygnus OB2 may imply that fast rotators has not been produced yet due to binary interactions; (ii) fast rotators may have been dynamically ejected from the core as runaway stars; (iii) local star formation conditions may hinder binary formation (reducing spin-up interactions) or result in slower rotational velocities at birth.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Planetary nebulae are shells ejected by low- and intermediate-mass stars. The slow wind ejected by the asymptotic giant branch star is compressed by a fast stellar wind to produce an expanding gaseous shell surrounding a hot bubble. The shell is a source of thermal radio emission which shows a spectral index between -0.1 and 2. Only two planetary nebulae are known to show non-thermal radio emission indicating magnetic fields and non-thermal electrons. Aims. The aim of this paper is verification of presence of magnetic fields of planetary nebulae. Magnetic fields can have a significant influence on shaping planetary nebulae. Methods. We observed a sample of northern planetary nebulae in radio continuum at 144 MHz with the Low Frequency Array. We combined our observations with archival observations at higher frequencies. Results. The spectral indices in 30 planetary nebulae were below -0.1, indicating non-thermal radio emission. The majority of this sample consists of bipolar planetary nebulae, which are known to originate from binary central stars. Most of the nebulae have sizes larger than 20 arcsec. Magnetic fields and nonthermal emission may be common in smaller planetary nebulae, but can be suppressed by thermal emission. Our results suggest that different mechanisms can be responsible for the origin of magnetic fields and non-thermal emission in planetary nebulae.
#### Molecular line emission from 1000 au scales outflows to <30 au compact structures in NGC1333 IRAS4A2

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Studying protostellar objects in their earliest stages, particularly during the Class 0 phase, provides key insight into the beginnings of planet formation and dust evolution. Disentangling the various components, however, is particularly challenging. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of molecular line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are therefore crucial for probing their complex environments. Methods. In this work, we present high-resolution ($\sim$30 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 millimeters of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS4A2. Results. We detected large, well-traced outflows in HCN (3-2), H$_{2}$CO$(2_{1~2}-1_{1~1})$, and HCO$^{+}$ (3-2), along with numerous complex organic molecules (COMs) tracing central, more compact regions. Using moment maps, we analyzed the kinematics and spatial distributions of the molecular emission, revealing a wide range of spatial scales, from compact structures within the IRAS4A2 core at $\sim$8 au in radius, to extended $\sim$5000 au outflow emission. Specifically, we find that CH$_{3}$CDO and CH$_{3}$OCHO could be both good tracers of the disk, possibly tracing its rotation. Lines of OCS (22-21), SO$_{2}~(13_{3~11}-13_{2~12})$, HCN, H$_{2}$CO, and HCO$^{+}$, show more extended structures around IRAS4A2, likely tracing the envelope, disk, accretion shocks, the base of an outflow, and the outflow itself. Conclusions. Most COMs appear to trace distinct inner regions near the central protostar, while other molecules trace more extended structures, such as the envelope or outflows. The kinematics, emission patterns, and position-velocity diagrams suggest that individual molecules trace multiple components simultaneously, making it challenging to disentangle their true origins. Altogether, these findings highlight the complex spatial distribution within the IRAS4A2 system. Abridged.
#### Spectroscopic Follow-up of Young High-$α$ Dwarf Star Candidates: Still Likely Genuinely Young

 - **Abstract**
 The question of whether genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars exist has been discussed for over a decade since their discovery from asteroseismology of giant stars as it is challenging to break the degeneracy between the binary interaction and the genuinely young scenarios. Young high-$\alpha$ stars are hard to explain with traditional chemical evolution model as the high-$\alpha$ disk is typically associated with the early epoch of star formation in the Milky Way. Combined with recent advances of gyrochronology, and that $^7$Li can serve as an unambiguous indicator for identifying merger products in dwarfs thanks to its low burning temperature, we identified young high-$\alpha$ dwarf candidate stars through their fast rotation in a previous study. In this paper, we performed high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates using Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI), and confirm 3 additional stars that are most likely genuinely young. Together with the star from the earlier paper, we find three out of four of them center around [Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, are ~5 Gyr old, and have a similar amount of elevated Li (~0.5 dex) and Al (~0.1 dex) compared to stars with matching $\log g$, $T_{\rm eff}$, Mg, and Fe within observational uncertainties, hinting at their common formation pathway.
#### Glycolaldehyde and ethanol toward the L1157 outflow: resolved images and constraints on glycolaldehyde formation

 - **Abstract**
 Two main formation routes have been proposed for interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs): on dust grain surfaces and in the gas phase. Observing such molecules in protostellar outflow shock regions - provided that their ages are well-constrained - can help distinguish between these pathways by probing chemical evolution over time. This study focuses on the potential daughter-mother relationship of glycolaldehyde (CH$_2$OHCHO) and ethanol (C$_2$H$_5$OH), previously proposed in the literature. We test whether gas-phase reactions converting ethanol into glycolaldehyde derived in these works can explain the observed abundance of the latter in star-forming regions. We target the southern outflow of L1157, which hosts three shock regions, B0, B1 and B2, of increasing ages: about 900, 1500 and 2300 yr. We obtained high-resolution IRAM NOEMA maps of three lines of glycolaldehyde and one line of ethanol. We derived their abundances in the three shocks and used a pseudo time-dependent astrochemical model to simulate gas-phase and grain-surface formation scenarios for glycolaldehyde. Ethanol is assumed to form on grains and be released in the gas by shocks, where it is gradually converted into glycolaldehyde via the ethanol-tree reaction network. We present the first spatially resolved maps of glycolaldehyde and ethanol in the L1157 southern outflow, and more generally toward solar-like star forming regions. The abundance ratio [CH$_2$OHCHO]/[C$_2$H$_5$OH] increases from B1 to B2, consistent with model predictions. However, the model cannot reproduce all three shocked regions simultaneously, suggesting that one of the assumptions of our model, such as the same excitation temperature and grain composition in B0, B1 and B2, or gas temperature evolution, is wrong. Nonetheless, our modeling rules out the possibility that all the observed gaseous glycolaldehyde is a grain-surface product.
#### Born to be recycled: a comprehensive population synthesis of the Galactic millisecond pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are the oldest but fastest pulsars known to date. To explain how these pulsars could be formed, a new hypothesis was formulated: the recycling of pulsars, i.e the fact that a pulsar could accrete matter from a companion and been spun up. In this paper, we developed a population synthesis algorithm for pulsars which belong to a binary, in order to check whether most of the observed recycled pulsars were formed via an accretion mechanism and derive statistics about their properties, that are difficult to obtain through observations. We also make predictions for future surveys. Toward the presented objectives, we use the code Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) to take into account all the binary processes and our own code to evolve each pulsar self-consistently by taking into account the secular evolution of a force-free magnetosphere, the magnetic field decay, gravitational braking and spatial evolution. Each pulsar is born in binary with a main sequence companion, and evolve to present time. The radio and $\gamma$-ray emission locations were modeled by the polar cap geometry and striped wind model, respectively. Our simulations seem to reproduce well the population of radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsars observed in the selected surveys. We also found that there should be less than $330$ unidentified pulsars in the Fourth Fermi-LAT catalogue of $\gamma$-ray sources (4FGL). High values of the viewing angle $\zeta$ seem to be needed to be able to observe the recycled pulsars, and it also seems difficult to observe recycled pulsars with an aligned rotation axis and magnetic axis (i.e., $\chi \leq 10$°). We find that only a small fraction, approximately $\sim 7.5\times10^{-3}$ %, of oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONeWDs) in binary systems appear to contribute to the population of mildly recycled pulsars through accretion-induced collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 The robust association of electromagnetic candidates discovered during follow-up of gravitational-wave alerts is challenging, not only due to the large sky areas and broad distance uncertainties, but also due to the tens to hundreds of unrelated optical transients that are observed per event. We present a Bayesian ranking method to identify electromagnetic counterparts to GW events using only location information. The framework combines three-dimensional gravitational wave skymaps with host-galaxy information, a morphology-aware host association, empirical offset priors, and peculiar velocity corrections. We apply the method to GW170817 where it ranks AT2017gfo as the top candidate and correctly selects NGC\,4993 as the host. The approach is directly applicable to transient candidates with only location information and enables more efficient follow-up with prioritized candidates and leads to more reliable counterpart identification in current and future observing runs.
