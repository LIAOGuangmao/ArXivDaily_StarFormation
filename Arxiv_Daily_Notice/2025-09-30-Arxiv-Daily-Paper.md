#### Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts from Micro-Tidal Disruption Events: The Case of GRB 250702B

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients with durations $>10^3$,s, remain poorly understood. GRB,250702B ($z=1.04$) is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray precursor $\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed precursor-main flare delay: (i) a \emph{dynamical (partial/repeating)} disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a \emph{natal-kick} disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a \emph{hybrid natal-kick + partial} case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.
#### Ross 458c: Gas Giant or Brown Dwarf?

 - **Abstract**
 Ross 458c is a widely separated planetary mass companion at a distance of 1100 AU from its host binary, Ross 458AB. It is a member of a class of very low-mass companions at distances of hundreds to thousands of AU from their host stars. We aim to constrain Ross 458c's formation history by fitting its near-IR spectrum to models to constrain its composition. If its composition is similar to its host star, we infer that it likely formed through turbulent fragmentation of the same molecular cloud that formed the host. If its composition is enhanced in heavy elements relative to the host, this lends evidence to formation in the disk and subsequent migration to its current separation. Here, we present high-resolution (R$\sim$2700) emission spectra of Ross 458c with JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit in the F070LP, F100LP, and F170LP filters from 0.8 to 3.1 $\mu$m. We fit these spectra using both grids of forward models (Sonora Bobcat, Sonora Elf Owl, and ExoREM) and atmospheric retrievals (POSEIDON). We also constrain the composition of Ross 458AB by fitting an archival SpeX spectrum with PHOENIX forward models. The forward model grids prefer an enhanced atmospheric metallicity for Ross 458c relative to the host, but our retrievals return a metallicity consistent with the host within 1$\sigma$. Our results offer new insights into the formation history of Ross 458c, as well as the efficacy of fitting forward model grids versus retrievals to derive atmospheric properties of directly imaged companions.

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming of neutrinos in an inhomogeneous medium is known to affect the physics of flavor conversion. We employ an ensemble of single-crossed angular distributions and explore the physics of flavor conversion, while neutrinos propagate across a one-dimensional inhomogeneous medium. The advective term in the neutrino equations of motion is responsible for the cascade of flavor waves towards ever smaller spatial and angular scales. However, as the system evolves, perturbations with large wavenumbers are damped, with a resulting smearing of the flavor configuration. We provide a simple recipe that allows to forecast the steady-state flavor configuration achieved by neutrinos without solving their kinetic equations. In particular, we find that flavor equipartition on one side of the angular spectrum and the cancellation of the spectral crossing in the lepton number distributions, proposed in the literature as generic flavor outcome, is a special solution depending on the degree of neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry. This work constitutes a step forward towards the development of semi-analytic schemes to account for flavor conversion physics in hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star merger remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 The empirical underabundance of close-in planets with radii 1.5-2.0 times that of the Earth, referred to as the radius irradiation valley, may be linked to the inability of gas dwarfs under certain conditions to retain their volatile envelopes due to photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. In either case, the extent to which a planet can preserve its atmosphere critically depends on poorly understood planetary magnetism. An effective probe of planetary magnetic fields is the interaction between a star and its close-in planet, where the planet magnetically interacts with its host, inducing flares as it moves near its periastron within the Alfvén surface of its host star. We construct a pipeline, \textsc{ardor}, to detect and characterize potentially planet-induced flares in time-series photometric data using a physically motivated forward model of star-planet interactions, with a focus on recovering flares located near the noise floor. We perform extensive injection-recovery simulations to determine our sensitivity to flares correlating with the planetary phase over a range of stellar types and orbital architectures. We identify one close-in, eccentric ($e=0.18$) system, TOI-1062\,b, which exhibits flaring during periastron consistent with being induced with $p_{KS}=2.2\times10^{-5}$ and a $5.1\sigma$ detection through unbinned likelihood analysis and goodness-of-fit tests. We also identify an additional eccentric ($e=0.363$) candidate, Gliese 49b, which exhibits moderately significant ($2.5\sigma$) flare clustering at periastron, requiring additional photometric observations to confirm its significance. TOI-1062b and Gliese 49b are promising candidates for induced flares, underscoring the need for radio and UV follow-up observations.
#### Coupled Planetary Interior and Tidal Evolution

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22923

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new planetary structure/thermal evolution model, designed for use in problems that couple orbital dynamics with planetary structure. We first benchmark our structural/thermal evolution calculations against the \texttt{MESA} stellar evolution code, finding excellent agreement across a wide range of planet mass, equilibrium temperature, entropy, and extra heating deposited at various depths in the planet. We then apply our method to study the tidal migration histories of Neptunes in the recently identified ``ridge" (periods ${\sim}3{-}6$ days), a feature that has been suggested to be populated via high eccentricity migration (HEM) of more distant Neptunes. We find that it is difficult to form a circularized Neptune in the ridge without instigating runaway tidal inflation and likely atmospheric destruction; low eccentricity Neptunes in the ridge can only be emplaced by HEM if they are metal-rich and exhibit finely-tuned tidal quality factors. If follow-up observations confirm that low eccentricity Neptunes in the ridge did arrive via HEM and are not strongly enriched in metals, our calculations indicate that their tidal heating mechanism must operate in the upper reaches of the planet to avoid runaway inflation. Gravity modes excited in upper radiative layers are a possible candidate mechanism, while friction in the core or turbulent dissipation in convective zones could be ruled out.
#### Dynamical Masses for 23 Pre-Main Sequence Stars in Upper Scorpius: A Critical Test of Stellar Evolutionary Models

 - **Abstract**
 We present dynamical masses for 23 pre-main sequence K- and M-type stars in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region. These masses were derived from the Keplerian rotation of CO disk gas using the MCMC radiative-transfer package pdspy and a flared-disk model with 15 free parameters. We compare our dynamical masses to those derived from five pre-main sequence evolutionary models, and find that most models consistently underestimate stellar mass by $\gtrsim$25%. Models with updated treatment of stellar magnetic fields are a notable exception $-$ they consistently return stellar masses in good agreement with the dynamical results. We find that the magnetic models' performance is valid even at low masses, in contrast with some literature results suggesting they may overestimate stellar mass for M$_{\star}$ $\lesssim$ 0.6 M$_{\odot}$. Our results are consistent with dynamical versus isochronal evaluations for younger samples (e.g. Taurus, 1-3 Myr), and extend the systematic evaluation of stellar evolutionary models up to stars $\sim$11 Myr in age. Finally, we derive disk dust masses to evaluate whether using dynamical masses versus isochronal masses changes the slope of the log(M$_{dust}$)$-$log(M$_{\star}$) relation. We derive a slightly shallower relation using dynamical masses versus isochronal masses, but the slopes of these relations agree within uncertainties. In all cases, we derive a steeper-than-linear relation for log(M$_{dust}$)$-$log(M$_{\star}$), consistent with previous literature results for Upper Sco.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparative analysis of interstellar hydrogen (HI) and potassium (KI) absorption from the radio and optical surveys, GASKAP and GALAH, to study the physical and kinematic properties of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way foreground towards the Magellanic Clouds. By comparing GASKAP HI absorption with interstellar KI absorption detected in GALAH spectra of nearby stars (within 12 arcmin angular distance or a spatial separation of ~0.75 pc), we reveal a strong kinematic correlation between these two tracers of the cold neutral ISM. The velocity offsets between matched HI and KI absorption components are small, with a mean (median) offset of -1.3 (-1.2) km s-1 and a standard deviation of 2.3 km s-1. The high degree of kinematic consistency suggests a close spatial association between Ki and cold HI gas. Correlation analyses reveal a moderate positive relationship between HI and KI line-of-sight properties, such as KI column density with HI column density or HI brightness temperature. We observe a ~63% overlap in the detection of both species towards 290 (out of 462) GASKAP HI absorption lines of sight, and estimate a median KI/HI abundance ratio of ~2.3 x 10^(-10), in excellent agreement with previous findings. Our work opens up an exciting avenue of Galactic research that uses large-scale surveys in the radio and optical wavelengths to probe the neutral interstellar medium through its diverse tracers.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of fullerene in the circumstellar environment of WRAY~16-232, a strong candidate luminous blue variable. Multiple pointings of archival \textit{Spitzer} IRS spectra reveal, for the first time, the presence of prominent vibrational bands of C$_{60}$ at 17.4 and 18.9~$\mu$m in an LBV envelope, along with the strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features. These observations suggest that, despite the harsh radiative conditions, large carbonaceous molecules can form, process and survive in the ejecta of massive stars. Complementary optical spectroscopy with SALT HRS shows multiple P\,Cygni profiles in H$\alpha$, He\,\textsc{i}, and Fe\,\textsc{ii} lines, which are indicative of a dense, expanding wind and substantial mass loss. Furthermore, analysis of decade long photometric data shows short-term brightness variations of $\sim$ 0.5~mag. These results not only reinforce the classification of WRAY~16-232 as a strong LBV candidate but also provide new insights into the mechanisms of dust formation and the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium by massive stars. We discuss various scenarios for fullerene formation in such environments, and find that shock processing due to wind-wind interactions could be playing a vital this http URL shell of WRAY~16-232 has an ideal UV field strength and the time scales appears to match with shock processing timescales. The results highlight the need for further high spatial/spectral resolution and temporal observations to confirm the formation and survival scenario of C$_{60}$ in its shell.

 - **Abstract**
 Close-in warm Jupiters orbiting M-dwarf stars are expected to exhibit diverse atmospheric chemistry, with clouds playing a key role in shaping their albedo, heat distribution, and spectral properties. We study WASP-80b, a warm Jupiter orbiting an M-dwarf star, using the latest JWST panchromatic emission and transmission spectra to comprehensively characterize its atmosphere, including cloud coverage, chemical composition, and particle sizes, and compare the observations with predictions from general circulation models (GCMs). We use a General Circulation Model (GCM), ADAM (ADvanced Atmospheric MITgcm, formerly known as SPARC/MITgcm), combined with the latest JWST data to study the atmosphere of WASP-80b. A cloud module with radiatively active, tracer-based clouds is integrated with the GCM to study the effects on the atmosphere and the spectrum. Our results indicate that both emission and transmission spectra are well fit by cloudless GCMs. The data appear to be compatible with large cloud particles of any cloud species or KCl clouds of all particle sizes. The Na$_2$S condensates of radii 0.1 and 1 $\mu$m can be ruled out due to the strength of their radiative feedback. This showcases the unique insights that can be obtained from global modelling of exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating the bubbles generated by the interaction between asymptotic giant branch stellar outflows and the interstellar medium (ISM) is pivotal for elucidating the mechanism by which evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars enrich the ISM with heavy elements. Using archival datasets from the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot survey and the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Array \ion{H}{1} survey, we have identified 14 bubbles within interstellar atomic hydrogen (\ion{H}{1}) maps, each showing evidence of potential association with planetary nebulae (PNe).We pursue two primary objectives centered on the identified ISM bubbles and their association with PNe. First, leveraging the calibrated distance measurements of PNe from Gaia Data Release 3, we utilize these ISM bubbles as observational tracers to investigate and constrain the Galactic rotation curve. Second, we note that distance determinations for some PNe remain unreliable, partly because their central stars are obscured by extended nebular envelopes or are misidentified. Therefore, we develop a novel methodological framework to derive kinematic distances for PNe by leveraging the velocities of their associated ISM bubbles and constraints from the Galactic rotation curve.

 - **Abstract**
 The ASTRI Mini-Array consists of nine Cherenkov telescopes under construction at the Observatorio del Teide, with one of them already performing observations since November 2024. Given the complexity of the analysis of gamma-ray data acquired with Cherenkov telescopes, a proper evaluation of the quality of these data is important to avoid a negative impact on the high-level scientific products. There are several factors that can contribute to reducing the quality of the observations, such as clouds, high humidity or a high dust concentration in the air, among others. In order to take all these factors into account and evaluate their impact on the data, a quality check pipeline has been developed for ASTRI. This contribution describes the pipeline, from its inputs at different data levels to the production of outputs in the form of good-quality lists and diagnostic plots. We also show how setting preliminary quality cuts on the Crab Nebula data taken with the first ASTRI telescope can significantly improve the source detection.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The dynamical evolution of open clusters in the tidal field of the Milky Way and the feeding of the disc field star population depend strongly on the initial conditions at the time of gas removal. Detailed dynamical models tailored to individual clusters help us understand the role of open clusters in the Galactic disc evolution. Aims. We present a detailed dynamical model of Praesepe, which reproduces the mass profile, the stellar mass function, and the mass segregation observed with the help of Gaia EDR3 data. Based on this model, we investigate the kinematic properties of the tidal tail stars in detail. Methods. We used direct N-body simulations along the eccentric orbit of Praesepe in the tidal field of the Milky Way, where each particle represents one star. The initial mass and size of the cluster, the dynamical state, and the initial mass function were adapted to reach the best-fitting model. Based on this model and a comparison model on a circular orbit, we analysed the stars in the tidal tails in terms of density, angular momentum, and orbit shapes. Results. Praesepe can be well reproduced by a cluster model with concentrated star formation in a supervirial state after instantaneous gas expulsion, adopting a global star formation efficiency of 17%. About 75% of the initially 7500 MSol are lost in the violent relaxation phase, and the observed mass segregation can be understood by two-body relaxation. We find that the self-gravity of the tail stars is the dominant force altering the angular momentum of the tail stars. For a typical star, the total change after escaping is about 1.6 kpc km/s. This corresponds to an offset in guiding radius of 7 pc, where tail stars contribute up to 70% to the alteration. The total radial shift of the orbit of the cluster in the Galactic plane can exceed 50 pc. This effect is not a result of the eccentricity of the orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 YSOs can display unpredictable and high-amplitude rises in brightness that can last from a few months to possibly over 100 years. These types of outbursts are explained by large changes in the mass accretion rate from the disk onto the central star. The outbursts support to a model of star formation (episodic accretion) where stars would spend most of their lifetimes accreting at low rates, and gain most of their mass through these short-lived accretion outbursts. The universality of episodic accretion, as well as its potential impact on stellar and planetary formation are still under debate. Improvement on the statistics of the members of the eruptive class is needed to better understand the episodic accretion phenomenon and its universality across different mass regimes and environments. In this paper we collect published information on the spectroscopic and photometric characteristics of 174 YSOs confirmed to belong to the eruptive variable class. We classify these objects into five different sub-classes (we find 49 FUor, 20 FUor-like, 16 EX Lupi-type, 81 Peculiar/V1647 Ori-like/MNors and 8 Periodic YSOs). The classification follows what has been done previously in the literature, and it is not an attempt to redefine these classes. In addition, we present a list of 18 embedded, and 6 massive YSOs, as additional categories of eruptive variable YSOs. Due to the complexity and/or faintness of these systems, it is hard to place them into the original classification scheme of this class of variable YSOs. Finally, we present a separate list of 355 candidate eruptive variable YSOs, which either lack spectroscopic information or the available spectroscopic data is not sufficient for an unambiguous classification. The online catalogue of confirmed and candidate eruptive YSOs will be maintained and updated in the future to serve as an important reference for the star formation community.

 - **Abstract**
 The EXTraS project, based on data collected with the XMM-Newton observatory, provided us with a vast amount of light curves for X-ray sources. For each light curve, EXTraS also provided us with a set of features (this https URL). We extract from the EXTraS database a tabular dataset of 31,832 variable sources by 108 features. Of these, 13,851 sources were manually labeled as stellar flares or non-flares based on direct visual inspection. We employ a supervised learning approach to produce a catalog of stellar flares based on our dataset, releasing it to the community. We leverage explainable AI tools and interpretable features to better understand our classifier. We train a gradient boosting classifier on 80\% of the data for which labels are available. We compute permutation feature importance scores, visualize feature space using UMAP, and analyze some false positive and false negative data points with the help of Shapley additive explanations -- an AI explainability technique used to measure the importance of each feature in determining the classifier's prediction for each instance. On the test set made up of the remainder 20\% of our labeled data, we obtain an accuracy of 97.1\%, with a precision of 82.4\% and a recall of 73.3\%. Our classifier outperforms a simple criterion based on fitting the light curve with a flare template and significantly surpasses a gradient-boosted classifier trained only on model-independent features. False positives appear related to flaring light curves that are not associated with a stellar counterpart, while false negatives often correspond to multiple flares or otherwise peculiar or noisy curves. We apply our trained classifier to currently unlabeled sources, releasing the largest catalog of X-ray stellar flares to date. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) is one of the key chemical species that controls and shapes a wide spectrum of astrophysical processes ranging from galaxy evolution to planet formation. Although the catalyzation on dust grain surfaces is considered as the dominant formation channel of H$_2$ in the interstellar medium (ISM), which could nonetheless suffer from the Boltzmann factor suppression at low temperatures. Here we demonstrate that quantum tunneling can dominate the H$_2$ formation process, effectively resolving the long-standing efficiency problem across a wide range of temperatures. By employing the path integral method in hybrid Monte Carlo simulations to account for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), we quantitatively identify that the tunneling of hydrogen atoms maintains relatively stable efficiencies even at temperatures below 50 K on both graphitic and silicate grain surfaces. The potential barriers associated with chemisorption/desorption and two-H association, rather than diffusion and hopping, are the dominant factors governing the actual reaction efficiency at low temperatures. These findings provide a solid physical foundation for molecule formation, which historically relied on ad-hoc formation rate multipliers to explain observed rates. The quantitative rates also offer new methodologies for observational constraints on H$_2$ formation and destruction, thereby enabling more accurate astrophysical models and interpretations on interstellar molecular materials.

 - **Abstract**
 When Carl Sagan and Ed Salpeter envisioned potential Sinkers, Floaters, and Hunters living in Jupiter's clouds in 1976 (C. Sagan & E. E. Salpeter 1976), the nature of life in Earth's atmosphere remained widely unknown. Decades later, research has revealed a remarkable variety of microorganisms in our atmosphere. However, the spectral features of airborne microbes as biomarkers for detecting atmospheric life remained a mystery. Here, we present the first reflectance spectra of biopigments of atmospheric microorganisms based on laboratory cultivars of seven microbial strains isolated from Earth's atmosphere. We show their distinct UV-resistant biosignatures and their impacts on models of diverse planetary scenarios, using Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) parameters. The reflectance of these biopigments from aerial bacteria creates the means to detect them on other Earth-like planets. It provides a paradigm shift that moves the search for life beyond the surface of a planet to ecosystems in atmospheres and clouds.
