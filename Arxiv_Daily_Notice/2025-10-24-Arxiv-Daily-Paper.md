 - **Abstract**
 The removal of gas left over from star formation has long been thought to dominate the dynamical evolution, and dissolution of star-forming regions. Feedback from massive stars from their stellar winds, photoionising radiation and supernovae is postulated to expel significant amounts of gas, altering the gravitational potential energy of the star-forming region and causing a supervirial expansion, which disperses the stars into the Galaxy on rapid timescales (<10Myr). The majority of previous work has utilised N-body simulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal. Here, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic simulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback from massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also scale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or faster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We find that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink particles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a simulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we would expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the dynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities directly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with (sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback processes does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the expansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of high-resolution mid-infrared observations at 25 and 37 $\mu m$ of the Sagittarius C Complex (Sgr C) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), based on data from the SOFIA/FORCAST Galactic Center Legacy Survey. Enabled by the high bright-source limit of the FORCAST instrument, we perform a map-level dust temperature and optical depth analysis with a focus on the Sgr C HII region, which has an average dust temperature of 61 K and an average 37 $\mu m$ optical depth of 0.05. We find that the Sgr C HII region contains several high-density dust emission ridges, with lengths of up to several parsecs. Noting prior evidence for nonthermal radio emission from these density ridges, we postulate that there is an enhancement of relativistic electrons within them, possibly attributable to diffusive shock acceleration induced by the wind of a known nearby Wolf-Rayet (WR) star impacting the density ridges and the ambient gas in the surrounding photo-dissociation region. Additionally, the tangential magnetic field in the outskirts of the Sgr C HII region may serve to confine the electrons within this region. We examined the heating effect of the WR star by calculating its heating profile and performing a spectral energy distribution modelling of the HII region. We found an integrated MIR luminosity of $(1.40\pm0.19)\times10^{6} L_\odot$, which implies that presently unidentified massive stars must be present in the HII region in addition to the WR star. We also present a brief analysis of adjacent regions, such as a mid-infrared/radio source denoted "Source C" and the G359.43+0.02 young stellar object cluster near the northern end of the prominent Sgr C non-thermal filament (NTF).

 - **Abstract**
 Resolving fine details of astronomical objects provides critical insights into their underlying physical processes. This drives in part the desire to construct ever-larger telescopes and interferometer arrays and to observe at shorter wavelength to lower the diffraction limit of angular resolution. Alternatively, one can aim to overcome the diffraction limit by extracting more information from a single telescope's aperture. A promising way to do this is spatial mode-based imaging, which projects focal-plane field onto a set of spatial modes before detection, retaining focal-plane phase information crucial at small angular scales but typically lost in intensity imaging. However, the practical implementation of mode-based imaging in astronomy from the ground has been challenged by atmospheric turbulence. Here, we present the first on-sky demonstration of a subdiffraction-limited, mode-based measurement using a photonic lantern (PL)-fed spectrometer installed on the SCExAO instrument at the Subaru Telescope. We introduce a novel calibration strategy that mitigates time-varying wavefront error and misalignment effects, leveraging simultaneously recorded focal-plane images and using a spectral-differential technique that self-calibrates the data. Observing the classical Be star $\beta$ CMi, we detected spectral-differential spatial signals and reconstructed images of its H$\alpha$-emitting disk. We achieved an unprecedented H$\alpha$ photocenter precision of 50$\mu$as in about 10-minute observation with a single telescope, measuring the disk's near-far side asymmetry for the first time. This work demonstrates the high precision, efficiency, and practicality of photonic mode-based imaging techniques to recover subdiffraction-limited information, opening new avenues for high angular resolution spectroscopic studies in astronomy.
#### Radiation Hydrodynamics of Self-gravitating Protoplanetary Disks: I. Direct Formation of Gas Giants via Disk Fragmentation

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational instability (GI) has long been considered a viable pathway for giant planet formation in protoplanetary disks (PPDs), especially at wide orbital separations or around low-mass stars where core accretion faces significant challenges. However, a primary drawback is that disk fragmentation from GI was generally found to produce over-massive clumps, typically in the mass range of brown dwarfs, although most numerical studies adopted simplified cooling prescriptions or with limited numerical resolution. We conduct a suite of global three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations of self-gravitating PPDs using the meshless finite-mass (MFM) method. By implementing radiation transport via the M1 closure and systematically varying disk mass and opacity, we show that increasing disk mass and lowering opacity promote fragmentation by enhancing radiative cooling. Non-fragmenting disks settle into a gravito-turbulent state with low-order spiral structures and effective angular momentum transport characterized by $\alpha \sim \beta_\mathrm{cool}^{-1}$. In fragmenting disks, a subset of gravitationally bound clumps survives as long-lived fragments. Their initial masses form a consistent distribution around $\Sigma \cdot\lambda_\mathrm{T} \cdot 2 (c_s/\Omega_\mathrm{K})$ (with $\lambda_T$ the Toomre wavelength), corresponding to $\sim 0.3 - 10\,M_\mathrm{J}$ in our simulations, consistent with being gas giants. These results demonstrate that GI can produce planet-mass fragments under more realistic conditions, reinforcing it as a viable gas giant formation pathway and motivating further studies of fragment evolution and observational signatures.
#### Pristine ices in a planet-forming disk revealed by heavy water

 - **Abstract**
 Water is essential to our understanding of the planet-formation process and habitability on Earth. Although trace amounts of water are seen across all phases of star and planet formation, the bulk of the water reservoir often goes undetected, hiding crucial parts of its journey from giant molecular clouds to planets. This raises the question of whether water molecules in comets and (exo-)planets is largely inherited from the interstellar medium or if the water molecules are destroyed and then reformed in the disk. Water isotopologue ratios involving doubly deuterated water (D$_2$O) are a sensitive tracer to answer this question. We present strong evidence of inheritance through an enhancement of D$_2$O in the outbursting V883 Ori disk. The high D$_2$O/H$_2$O ratio of $(3.2 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{-5}$ is consistent with values seen in protostellar envelopes and a comet and is two orders of magnitude higher than expected if water is reprocessed. The high deuteration of the heaviest isotopologues D$_2$O/HDO = $(2.3 \pm 1.0) \times $HDO/H$_2$O further establishes the inheritance of water. We conclude that water ice in disks originates from the earliest phases of star formation, providing the missing link between cold dark clouds and (exo-)comets.
#### Confirming the uniformity of the Hubble flow with Pantheon+ Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 According to the perturbed Friedmann model, the difference between Hubble constant measurements in two rest frames, at leading order in velocity, is determined solely by the relative motion of the observers and remains unaffected by the peculiar velocities of the sources. This implies that, when averaging over a sufficiently large and distant set of sources where local nonlinear inhomogeneities are diminished, such a difference should vanish, so that the Hubble flow is statistically uniform, as predicted by the Cosmological Principle -- a core assumption of the standard cosmological paradigm. In previous works, distance measurement compilations, e.g. the CosmicFlows-3 catalogue, were used for this purpose, as it comprises a large number ($\sim 10^4$) of sources of different types. Due to the increasing amount of precise luminosity distance measurements of Type Ia Supenovae (SNe) in the last few years, in this work we investigate whether we can confirm the uniformity of the Hubble flow with low-$z$ SN distances only. By means of the Pantheon+ and SH0ES compilation, we find that the results align well with previous works based on the CF3 catalogue, and are in good agreement with the expected Hubble variance in the standard model across cosmic scales of $20-150$ Mpc. Notably, the Hubble constant difference $\Delta H_0 \approx 0$ is observed at around $85$ Mpc. Despite the smaller sample size ($\sim 10^2$ versus $\sim 10^4$) relative to CF3 at those scales, our analysis show that the Pantheon+ and SH0ES dataset supports the standard model paradigm, which indicates that the Hubble flow becomes statistically uniform at around $70-100$ Mpc, which is compatible with independent determinations of the homogeneity scale based on galaxy number counts.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars often evolve in binary systems, in which binary interactions significantly affect their evolution. Massive stars in the Galaxy serve as valuable testbeds for this due to their proximity. We computed the evolution of more than 38000 galactic binary systems with initial primary star masses of 5...100 Msun. In this paper, we aim to investigate the surface properties of post-mass transfer mass donor and mass gainer stars through core hydrogen burning, core helium burning, and for the pre-supernova stage. The models are computed with MESA, incorporating detailed stellar and binary physics, including internal differential rotation, magnetic angular momentum transport, mass-dependent overshooting, stellar wind mass-loss, mass and angular momentum transfer and tidal interaction. They incorporate a new extensive nuclear network for hydrogen burning, which allows us to track the full range of hydrogen burning nucleosynthesis products, from the light elements to aluminum. The widest, non-interacting binary models in our grid effectively serve as single star models. We find that mass gainers and mass donors may evolve through long-lived blue and yellow supergiant stages during core helium burning where single stars of the same mass remain red supergiants. Furthermore, some of our gainers evolve into more luminous yellow and blue supergiants prior to core collapse than single stars, while some donors end their life as red or yellow supergiants, showing a rich diversity in supernova progenitors. We show that the surface elemental and isotopic abundances carry valuable information about a star's evolutionary history and can be used to distinguish binary interaction products from single stars. Our binary model grid may serve as a tool for identifying post-mass transfer stars and supernovae, and holds potential for population studies, supernova modeling, and guidance of future observations.
#### Magnetic flux cancellation in the solar atmosphere through 3D realistic numerical modeling

 - **Abstract**
 We present a radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulation of a magnetic cancellation event. The model is calculated with the Bifrost code and spans from the uppermost convection zone to the corona. The cancellation occurs between the positive polarity of an emerged magnetic bipole and a preexisting negative polarity. We try both to understand the RMHD aspects as well as to carry out comparison to observations, in part via spectral synthesis of optically thick photospheric and chromospheric lines using the RH1.5D code, and optically thin coronal ones. The reconnection between the opposite flux systems takes place at chromospheric heights through a quasi-separatrix layer without null points. Sharp V-shaped upward-moving field lines and highly warped downward-moving post-reconnection loops are created. The chromospheric reconnection is in full swing when the colliding magnetic patches are still separated by a granular cell at the photosphere. In a later phase, photospheric cancellation takes place with submergence of the closed magnetic loops linking the opposite polarities. We carry out comparisons with the observations of the photospheric magnetic flux loss rates, as well as of the horizontal magnetic field and vertical velocity at the polarity inversion line. The reconnection outflows cause intensity brightenings, jets and different spectral features in the synthesized chromospheric spectral lines, strongly reminiscent of those found in recent observations. Coherent, twisted magnetic flux ropes are created by the flows associated with the process. Including coronal levels is crucial for proper modeling, even if no major ejection or brightening is produced in the corona in this event.

 - **Abstract**
 In a recent arXiv post, Hawkins & Garcia-Bellido raised doubts on the results of 20-yr long OGLE photometric monitoring, which did not find a large number of gravitational microlensing events in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds. These results implied that primordial black holes and other compact objects with masses from 10^{-8} to 10^3 M_solar cannot comprise a substantial fraction of the Milky Way dark matter halo. Unfortunately, the Hawkins & Garcia-Bellido post contained a number of scientific misrepresentations of our work. Here, we demonstrate that their arguments lack a solid basis or are simply incorrect. As we show below, "and yet they are not found" - compact objects (including primordial black holes) in the dark halo of the Milky Way remain undetected, despite extensive searches.
#### Impact of the nuclear equation of state on the explodability of massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, astrophysical observations have placed tight constraints on key properties of the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Using 45 two-dimensional simulations for three different EoS compatible with the current tight constraints, we show that the EoS remains a major uncertainty for the outcome of core-collapse supernovae. Whereas explosions are obtained in most cases for the SFHo and SFHx EoS, for the CMF EoS, which includes a crossover from nucleonic matter to a quark phase, explosions occur only for 2 out of 15 progenitors. Less favourable conditions for neutrino-driven explosions arise for the CMF EoS due to lower neutrino luminosities and mean energies and slightly weaker contraction of the warm proto-neutron star. Our results suggest that the explodability of massive stars cannot yet be predicted based on first principles without better knowledge of the nuclear EoS. Conversely, observational constraints on stellar explodability may help further constrain the EoS.
#### Unexpected Near-Resonant and Metastable States of Young Multi-Planet Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations suggest that the incidence of near-resonant planets declines as planetary systems age, making young planetary systems key signposts of early dynamical evolution. Here we investigate the dynamical states of three of the youngest multi-transiting planetary systems: AU Mic (3-planet, $\sim$20-Myr-old), V1298 Tau (4-planet, $\sim$23-Myr-old), and TOI-2076 (4-planet, $\sim$200-Myr-old). We find that most planet pairs in these systems lie near resonance with circulating rather than librating resonant angles. As a result, they are more susceptible to dynamical chaos than systems that are either securely locked in resonance or far removed from it. Even modest eccentricities of 0.04 to 0.08 may drive them to instability on timescales of tens to hundreds of Myr. Moreover, the observed orbital architectures are vulnerable to eccentricity excitation through mechanisms such as divergent resonance crossing triggered by planetesimal scattering. The observed near-resonant state may represent a transitional phase between a librating resonant chains and a mature non-resonant planetary system. Finally, we briefly discuss mechanisms that could give rise to the observed near-resonant configurations, including overstable libration, disk turbulence, and receding disk inner edge.
#### Exploring Joint Observation of the CSST Shear and clustering of astrophysical gravitational wave source measurements

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive forecast for cosmological constraints using the joint observation of the cosmic shear signal from the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) and the clustering signal from the next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detector networks, e.g. Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). By leveraging the angular clustering of astrophysical gravitational wave sources (AGWS) from the third-generation detectors and CSST's weak lensing surveys, we develop a theoretical framework to compute auto- and cross-angular power spectra of AGWS clustering, cosmic shear, and their cross-correlation. Mock datasets are generated by considering the detector-specific selection functions, uncertainties in luminosity distance, and weak lensing systematics. We employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to constrain the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological parameters, AWGS bias parameters, and star formation rate (SFR) parameters under three detector configurations. Our results demonstrate that the joint observation can achieve sub-$5\%$ precision on $H_0$ ($2.19\%$) and $w$ ($5.7\%$). Besides, the AGWS clustering bias parameters can be constrained to the precision of $4\%-5\%$, enabling the differentiation between stellar-origin compact binaries and primordial black hole scenarios. This multi-messenger approach can also be helpful to resolve mass-redshift degeneracies in the dark siren methods, providing independent validation for the Hubble tension. Our work indicates that the joint observation of the third-generation GW detectors and the CSST can be a powerful probe of the large-scale structure and the cosmic expansion history.
#### Satellite Underflight Utility for Thermal Sensor Harmonization

 - **Abstract**
 Underflight maneuvers provide a unique opportunity to harmonize calibration of on-orbit sensors. Due to their similar sensor technologies, their near-identical transmission profiles, orbital properties and platform operations, the underflight data of Landsat 8 and 9 instruments stand out as a qualifier to test proposed metrics, methods, and the extent over which to compare two independently calibrated sensors across their similar operating bandpasses. This study performed a pixel-to-pixel comparison of thermal imagery of TIRS and TIRS-2 (aboard Landsat 8 and 9, respectively) during their five-day underflight maneuver in November 2021, with the ultimate goal of identifying the key site/scene-selection criteria for a subset of images that are suitable for radiative calibration validation purposes. If a group of near-coincidentally observed images by two identical underflying sensors fail to show consistent Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) Brightness Temperatures for the same exact geographical locations, then the scenes with those shared properties and/or observing conditions will prove unreliable for cross calibration validation of less-similar underflying sensor pairs. This study demonstrates that near-coincidental images with Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSDs) of less than 5\% between their TOA radiances are optimum candidates for cross-validation of radiative calibration between two independently calibrated sensors. This criterion is shown to be reliable for coincidental acquisitions with a wide range of overlapping area, terrain type, land-to-water fraction and cloud coverage. Important considerations include any time gap between near-coincident acquisitions as well as the application of pixel quality masks. The analysis of the selected underflight scenes demonstrated an agreement between the TIRS on Landsat 8 and 9 to within 0.123 K and 0.066 K for the 10.9um and 12.0um bands respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a formalism of mixing induced by non-orographic gravity waves (GWs) to integrate with the stochastic GWs scheme in the Mars Planetary Climate Model. We derive the formalism of GWs and their mixing under the same assumptions, integrating the two schemes within a unified framework. Specifically, a surface-to-exosphere parameterization of GW-induced turbulence has been derived in terms of the eddy diffusion coefficient. Simulations show that the coefficient is on the order of 1E4 to 1E9 cm2 s-1 and a turbopause is at altitudes of 70 to 140 km, varying with seasons. The triggered mixing has minor effects on model temperatures, yet it substantially impacts upper atmospheric abundances. Simulations are consistent with observations from the Mars Climate Sounder and the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer. Mixing enhances the tracer transports in the middle and upper atmosphere, governing the dynamics of these regions. The scheme reveals how non-orographic GW-induced turbulence can regulate upper atmospheric processes, such as tracer escape.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an assessment of the effects of stellar wind magnetic and mechanical components on the habitability of Earth-like exoplanets orbiting the inner and outer radii of the habitable zone (HZ) of M dwarfs. We consider stars with masses in the range of $0.09 - 0.75 M_\odot$ and planets with a surface dipolar magnetic field of 0.5 G. We estimate the size of the magnetospheres of such exoplanets using the pressure balance equation including the contribution of magnetic and ram pressures from stellar winds. We explore different scenarios, including fast and slow stellar winds, to assess the relevance of kinetic contribution. Furthermore, the effect of tidal locking and potential deviations from the Parker spiral, typically used to describe the interplanetary magnetic field, are analyzed. We show that for low mass stars ($M < 0.15 M_\odot$), the ram pressure exerted by stellar winds affects the size of the magnetosphere more than the stellar wind magnetic pressure. Interestingly, when the ram pressure is not much stronger than the magnetic pressure, typically for higher mass stars, the inclusion of ram pressure can be beneficial to the magnetosphere due to the magnetopause currents. A magnetosphere with the size of that of modern Earth is difficult to achieve with the current assumptions. However, an early Earth magnetosphere is achieved by roughly half of our hypothetical planets orbiting the outer radius of the HZ in most of the considered cases. We find that deviations from the Parker spiral can affect the results significantly, reducing the magnetosphere by $56\%$ in extreme cases. Most of the hypothetical planets are most likely (or might be) tidally locked, with the notable exception of those orbiting the outer HZ of GJ 846 and V1005 Ori.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we have studied the masses, equatorial radii and gravitational wave strain amplitudes of strongly magnetized oblate spheroidal quark stars. We have used an anisotropic Equation of State (EoS) based on the MIT bag model, extended to incorporate the effects of strong magnetic fields and the resulting pressure anisotropy due to the breaking of spatial rotational symmetry. Our analysis includes both magnetized free strange quark matter (MSQM) and magnetized color-flavor locked (MCFL) phases. The masses and equatorial radii are computed using the stellar structure equations in presence of the {\gamma}-metric. We also computed the ellipticity, the gravitational redshift, the mass quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability for two values of bag constants: 65 MeV/ fm^3 and 75 MeV/ fm^3, for both MSQM and MCFL phases. Additionally, using the mass quadrupole moment, we have calculated the gravitational wave strain amplitudes for isolated deformed rotating magnetized quark stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to Gaia and large-scale spectroscopic follow-up surveys (4MOST, DESI, WEAVE, SDSS-V), it is now possible to build representative and minimally biased samples of the local white dwarf population. Here we analyse several volume-limited 100pc samples of white dwarfs, constructed from different surveys and studies, to evaluate their completeness and residual biases. We model the underlying star formation history and Galactic disc age via comparison with simulated populations of white dwarfs to quantitatively characterise completeness. We assess whether the benefit of Gaia XP spectra in datasets outweighs the reduction in sample size, and to what extent targeted, part-sky, and magnitude limited surveys can be used in comparison to all-sky volume limited surveys. Additionally, we simulate the 4MOST 100PC sub-survey and discuss its use to better understand the local star formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 We employ first-principles, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate magnetic field-line curvature in magnetically dominated turbulent plasmas and its role in particle acceleration through curvature-drift motion along the motional electric field. By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\kappa$ tails for $\delta B_0/B_0 \gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\delta B_0/B_0 \ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\bf v}_E \cdot {\bf \kappa}$, with ${\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\bf\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.

 - **Abstract**
 Extragalactic very high-energy (VHE; $E>100\,$GeV) gamma rays suffer absorption in interactions with photons of the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL). The EBL is an isotropic diffuse photon field from optical to infrared wavelengths, which is difficult to measure directly due to strong foreground emission. We present niebla, the first open-source code to compute the EBL using a forward-folding approach that accepts fully customizable inputs. This software enables a detailed modelling of the influence of EBL opacities on VHE observations and facilitates the distinction between different dust reemission models. The code models the optical background primarily from stellar emission, by evolving the spectrum of a single stellar population as a function of redshift, considering mean metallicity evolution and star formation rate density. Additional sources to the EBL can be provided by the user. The code already includes optional contributions from, e.g., stripped stars, intra-halo light, or the decay of axion dark matter. The optical emissivity is then absorbed by interstellar dust and reemitted in the infrared regime. We provide multiple prescriptions to model this process, using spectral dust templates or a combination of blackbodies. We provide three EBL models calculated with different dust reemission prescriptions, which have been fitted to various observational data sets. In addition, we showcase the versatility of our model through a simulated observation of the blazar Markarian 501 in a high-flux state with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory array. We find that the simulated VHE spectrum is highly sensitive to the EBL opacity coming from the infrared. Our model will therefore allow the community to distinguish between different dust reemission models and constrain EBL parameters with future observations.

 Scattering polarization signals offer a unique diagnostics of the physical conditions in the solar atmosphere, in particular magnetic fields via the Hanle effect. However, their spatial structure remains poorly constrained due to the difficulty of achieving high spatial resolution and polarimetric sensitivity simultaneously. We present the first direct observation of sub-arcsecond structuring in the linear scattering polarization of the photospheric Sr i 4607 Ã\, line near the solar disk center ($\mu$ = 0.74), obtained with the Visible Spectro- Polarimeter (ViSP) at the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). The data achieve about 0".2 resolution with 30 s integration and sufficient sensitivity to detect fine-scale patterns in the total linear polarization, which are evident in Sr i but absent in a nearby Fe i line that is simultaneously observed. Since this Fe i line is more Zeeman-sensitive than the Sr i 4607 Ã\, this disparity confirms that the signals in the Sr i 4607 Ã\, line arise from scattering. These data provide the first spatially resolved two-dimensional maps of photospheric scattering polarization at sub-arcsecond scales, enabled by the capabilities of a 4-meter solar telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Glitches in neutron stars originate from the sudden transfer of angular momentum between superfluid components and the observable crust. By modeling this glitch dynamics, including vortex motion, mutual friction, and angular momentum exchange, we can probe the dense matter equation of state. We match theoretical predictions of glitch rise times, overshoot patterns, and relaxation timescales to the well-documented observations of the 2016 Vela glitch. Our model incorporates microphysical parameters such as the mutual friction coefficient $\mathcal{B}$, which in the core arises from electron scattering off magnetized vortices, and in the crust from Kelvin wave excitation during vortex-lattice interactions. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the timing residuals reveals detailed glitch dynamics: the crustal superfluid couples on timescales of $\sim100$ seconds, the core exhibits overshoot behavior due to strong central behavior, and the inner crust shows weak entrainment, with $\sim70\%$ of free neutrons remaining superfluid. The modeled rise times are consistent with the observed upper limit of 12.6 seconds, and the observed overshoot requires strong crustal friction but weak core friction, supporting a spatially varying $\mathcal{B}$.These findings highlight the importance of microphysical modeling and demonstrate the potential of future high-cadence timing observations to further constrain the internal dynamics and composition of neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning has emerged as a transformative methodology in modern cosmology, providing powerful tools to extract meaningful physical information from complex astronomical datasets. This paper implements a novel Bayesian graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.
