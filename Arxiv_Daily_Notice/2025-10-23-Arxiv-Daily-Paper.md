#### Intermediate-Mass Stripped Stars in the Magellanic Clouds: Forward Modeling the Observed Population Discovered Via UV Excess

 - **Abstract**
 Stripped stars are hot, helium-rich stars formed when binary interactions remove a star's hydrogen envelope. While low-mass ($\lesssim 1\,M_\odot$) and high-mass ($\gtrsim 8\,M_\odot$) stripped stars are well studied as hot subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars, their intermediate-mass counterparts ($1-8 \,M_\odot$) have only recently been discovered. The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS) identified UV-excess sources in the Magellanic Clouds using Swift-UVOT photometry and selected 820 photometric stripped-star candidates. However, the selection function, completeness, and purity of this sample remain poorly understood. We forward model the population of stripped stars in the Magellanic Clouds using a binary population synthesis model combined with spatially resolved star formation histories and simulated UV photometry. To assess survey sensitivity, we inject simulated sources into real Swift-UVOT images and reproduce the SUMS selection process, including crowding, extinction, and photometric quality cuts. We recover $\sim 250$ simulated stripped stars with masses $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a recover rate of $9-13\,\%$. The rest are missed due to dilution by luminous companions, crowding, and high extinction. The observed population is biased toward systems with low-mass companions formed by common envelope evolution and toward systems with compact object companions. Of the stripped stars which show UV excess, $25-45\,\%$ are identifiable by SUMS; higher-resolution data or improved reddening corrections are needed to detect the rest. We predict contamination of the observed stripped star candidates by main-sequence stars with spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting higher-purity subsamples. These results enable tests of binary evolution models and realistic comparison of observed and simulated stripped-star populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic macroscopic plasma dynamics can be described by general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In many high-energy astrophysical settings, such as the interior dynamics of magnetized stars, the ideal GRMHD approximation, in which we assume infinite conductivity, provides an excellent description. However, ideal GRMHD neglects resistive effects that are essential for processes such as magnetic reconnection, dissipation, and magnetospheric dynamics. Incorporating resistivity into astrophysical plasma models accounts for the fact that plasmas in such environments are not perfect conductors. We present a resistive version of the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X, which evolves the full resistive GRMHD equations using the Z4c formalism for Einstein's equations. We implement a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme to handle stiff source terms, obtain the primitive quantities from the conserved quantities using a one-dimensional recovery method, and employ the HLLE Riemann solver in combination with TVD and WENO reconstruction schemes. We validate the module using a range of standard tests, including 1D shocktubes, current sheets, Alfvén waves, 2D cylindrical explosions, and 3D TOV stars. The results of these tests demonstrate accurate recovery of the ideal MHD limit, correct resistive behavior, and stable evolution in dynamical spacetimes. Leveraging the GPU-accelerated resistive version of GRaM-X enables efficient large-scale simulations, paving the way for realistic studies of binary mergers, accretion flows, and relativistic jets within the framework of multi-messenger astrophysics.
#### Modeling the Optical Colors of Galactic Cirrus Clouds in the Stripe 82 Region

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have shown that the optical colors of Galactic cirrus clouds differ significantly from those of extragalactic sources; thus, they can be used to distinguish Galactic cirrus from extragalactic low surface brightness (LSB) features. To understand these properties, we calculate radiative transfer models in dust clouds, where photons are incident from the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). Dust clouds are modeled to mimic a turbulent medium using a fractional Brownian motion algorithm, resulting in a lognormal density distribution and a power-law power spectral density that are appropriate for the ISM. The results are compared with optical observations of cirrus clouds in the Stripe 82 region. The observed color--color ($g-r$, $r-i$, and $i-z$) diagrams of the cirrus clouds can be reproduced by scattered light if the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) of Mathis et al. (as updated by Draine) is modified, either by reducing the intensities in the $i$ and $z$ bands or by enhancing those in the $g$ and $r$ bands. Similar results can also be obtained by adjusting the scattering albedos at the corresponding wavelengths. This demonstrates that the color--color diagrams are effective not only for identifying extragalactic LSB features but also for studying the ISRF and the properties of interstellar dust.

 - **Abstract**
 Surrounding Sgr A*, a cluster of young and massive stars coexist with a population of dust-enshrouded objects, whose astrometric data can be used to scrutinize the nature of Sgr A*. An alternative to the black hole (BH) scenario has been recently proposed in terms of a supermassive compact object composed of self-gravitating fermionic dark matter (DM). Such horizon-less configurations can reproduce the relativistic effects measured for S2 orbit, while being part of a single continuous configuration whose extended halo reproduces the latest GAIA-DR3 rotation curve. In this work, we statistically compare different fermionic DM configurations aimed to fit the astrometric data of S2, and five G-sources, and compare with the BH potential when appropriate. We sample the parameter spaces via Markov Chain Monte Carlo statistics and perform a quantitative comparison estimating Bayes factors for models that share the same likelihood function. We extend previous results of the S2 and G2 orbital fits for 56 keV fermions (low core-compactness) and show the results for 300 keV fermions (high core-compactness). For the selected S2 dataset, the former model is slightly favoured over the latter. However, more precise S2 datasets, as obtained by the GRAVITY instrument, remain to be analysed in light of the fermionic models. For the G-objects, no conclusive preference emerges between models. For all stellar objects tested, the BH and fermionic models predict orbital parameters that differ by less than 1%. More accurate data, particularly from stars closer to Sgr A*, is necessary to statistically distinguish between the models considered.
#### Linking Magnetic Field Diagnostics with 3D CME Speeds in Solar Active Regions

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how active-region properties influence coronal mass ejection (CME) dynamics is essential for constraining eruption models and improving space-weather prediction. Magnetic diagnostics derived above polarity inversion lines (PILs), including the critical height ($h_{\rm crit}$) of torus instability onset, the overlying field strength ($B_{\rm t}$), and ribbon flux ($R_{\rm f}$), provide physically motivated measures of eruption onset. The two main aims of this work are to (i) show that $h_{\rm crit}$ and $B_{\rm t}$ can equally well predict CME speeds when evaluated over the region of interest (ROI) not directly above the PIL, and (ii) assess the value of $h_{\rm crit}$, $B_{\rm t}$ and $R_{\rm f}$ in predicting CME speed. Photospheric magnetograms are modeled with potential-field extrapolations to obtain decay index profiles. Critical heights above PILs correlate strongly with 3D CME speed ($r = 0.71$). Using ROIs of $\approx$ 1.8, 3.7, and 7.3 Mm), centered on the PIL, weighted $h_{\rm crit}$ from the 7.3x7.3 ROI provides the strongest correlation ($r = 0.73$), while mean $B_{\rm t}$ at 150 Mm is weaker ($r = 0.33$). Combining both offers little improvement ($r = 0.74$), confirming $h_{\rm crit}$ as the dominant predictor. CME speed correlates moderately with $B_{\rm t} \times R_{\rm f}$ ($r = 0.44$), and highest when combined with $h_{\rm crit}$ ($r = 0.76$). Thus, in potential field models, ROI-based critical heights are as predictive as those above the PIL, indicating that the broader active-region field structure is equally valid as a diagnostic. When all parameters are considered together, $h_{\rm crit}$ alone consistently shows the highest predictive power for CME speed.
#### Evidence of Energy Injection in the Short and Distant GRB 250221A

 - **Abstract**
 We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBRÍ, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB~250221A an unusual event and underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.

#### The impact of superradiance on the spin evolution of variably accreting massive black holes

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores how time-varying increases in mass accretion onto rapidly spinning black holes influence their long-term spin evolution when affected by superradiance - a process where energy is extracted from the black hole by a surrounding axion field. Using simulations the study tracks how sudden accretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop) during which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains nearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition between two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion, and how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that boosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest effect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the region of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In particular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion, lasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce the superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In contrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause temporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes with lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show observable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier axion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to produce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Early interaction of supernova blast waves with CSM has the potential to accelerate particles to PeV energies, although this has not yet been detected. Current models for this interaction assume the shock expands into a smooth stellar wind, although observations of many SNe do not support this assumption. We extend previous work by considering shocks expanding into complex density profiles consisting of smooth winds with dense CSM shells at various distances from the progenitor star. We aim to predict the gamma-ray and multiwavelength signatures of CSM interaction. We used the PION code to model the CSM around LBV including a brief episode of enhanced mass-loss and to simulate the formation of photoionization-confined shells around RSGs. Consequently, we used the time-dependent acceleration-code RATPaC to study the acceleration of cosmic rays in SNe expanding into these media and to evaluate the emitted radiation across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. We find that the interaction with the CSM shells can significantly boost the gamma-ray emission, with the emission peaking weeks to years after the explosion. The peak luminosity for Type-IIP and Type-IIn remnants can exceed the luminosity expected for smooth winds by orders of magnitude. For Type-IIP explosions, the light-curve peak is only reached years after the explosion. We evaluate the multiwavelength signatures expected from the interaction of the blast wave with a dense CSM shell from radio, over optical, to thermal X-rays. We identify high-cadence optical surveys and continuous monitoring of nearby SN in radio and mm wavelengths as the best-suited strategies for identifying targets that should be followed-up by gamma-ray observatories. We predict that gamma-rays from interaction with dense CSM shells may be detectable out to a few Mpc for late interaction, and tens of Mpc for early interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 Powerful ionized accretion disk winds are often observed during episodic outbursts in Galactic black hole transients. Among those X-ray absorbers, \fexxvi\ doublet structure (Ly$\alpha_1$+Ly$\alpha_2$ with $\sim 20$eV apart) has a unique potential to better probe the underlying physical nature of the wind; i.e. density and kinematics. We demonstrate, based on a physically-motivated magnetic disk wind scenario of a stratified structure in density and velocity, that the doublet line profile can be effectively utilized as a diagnostics to measure wind density and associated velocity dispersion (due to thermal turbulence and/or dynamical shear motion in winds). Our simulated doublet spectra with post-process radiative transfer calculations indicate that the profile can be (1) broad with a single peak for higher velocity dispersion ($\gsim 5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$), (2) a standard shape with 1:2 canonical flux ratio for moderate dispersion ($\sim 1,000-5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) or (3) double-peaked with its flux ratio approaching 1:1 for lower velocity dispersion ($\lsim 1,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) in optically-thin regime, allowing various line shape. Such a diversity in doublet profile is indeed unambiguously seen in recent observations with XRISM/Resolve at microcalorimeter resolution. We show that some implications inferred from the model will help constrain the local wind physics where \fexxvi\ is predominantly produced in a large-scale, stratified wind.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric tomography, the problem of reconstructing atmospheric turbulence profiles from wavefront sensor measurements, is an integral part of many adaptive optics systems. It is used to enhance the image quality of ground-based telescopes, such as for the Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics Relay For ELT Observations (MORFEO) instrument on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). To solve this problem, a singular-value decomposition (SVD) based approach has been proposed before. In this paper, we focus on the numerical implementation of the SVD-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain Regularization Algorithm (SAFR) and its performance for Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems. The key features of the SAFR algorithm are the utilization of the FFT and the pre-computation of computationally demanding parts. Together, this yields a fast algorithm with less memory requirements than commonly used Matrix Vector Multiplication (MVM) approaches. We evaluate the performance of SAFR regarding reconstruction quality and computational expense in numerical experiments using the simulation environment COMPASS, in which we use an MCAO setup resembling the physical parameters of the MORFEO instrument of the ELT.
#### Revisiting the Radio Lateral Distribution Function: An amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$ and primary composition

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19606

 - **Abstract**
 We show that there is a strong dependence of the radio LDF electric field amplitudes at ground level on the position of $X_{\rm max}$ in the atmosphere, even accounting for differences in the EM energy of the showers. Since an $X_{\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this implies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF shape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\rm max}$ dependence can be explained in terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes with $(1/\rho)^J$, where $\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\rm max}$ and $J$ is a zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density scaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other scaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\rm max}$ to the core at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper showers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to larger measured electric fields as $X_{\rm max}$ increases. The picture at higher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the deflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time delays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission. This loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic field and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission with decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly infer, even bypassing any $X_{\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary composition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions on other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\rm max}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods.
#### FAUST. XXVIII. High-Resolution ALMA Observations of Class 0/I Disks: Structure, Optical Depths, and Temperatures

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution (~7.5 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 and 3 mm of 16 disks around Class 0/I protostars across multiple star-forming regions and a variety of multiplicities, showing a range of disk sizes (~2-100 au) and including circumbinary disks (CBDs) in binaries with separations <100 au. The disk properties show similarities to Class II disks, including (a) low spectral index (SI) values (alpha=2.1) that increase with disk radius, (b) 3 mm disk sizes only marginally smaller than at 1.3 mm (<10%), and (c) radial intensity profiles well described by modified self-similar profiles. We also find key differences: (i) SI values increasing with radius, but exceeding 2 only at the disk edge (ii) higher brightness temperatures Tb, in some cases higher than the predicted temperatures due to irradiation, and (iii) ~10x higher luminosity at a given size compared to the Class II disks. These results confirm significant optical depth in the observed Class 0/I disks, at both 1.3 and 3 mm, helping to explain their higher luminosities, but higher temperatures are also required for the most compact (< 40 au) disks, suggesting additional viscous heating. Considering optical depth, most disk dust masses are estimated in the range 30-900 Mearth (0.01-0.3 Msun in gas), resulting in some disks reaching marginal gravitational instability. The median location of the water iceline is ~3 au, but it can extend beyond 10-20 au for the hottest disks. CBDs exhibit lower optical depths at both wavelengths and hence higher SI values (alpha=3.0), dust masses of 100 Mearth, and beta~1.5 (2 Class 0 CBDs) and beta~1 (1 Class I CBD), suggesting substantial grain growth only in the more evolved CBD. The inferred high optical depths provide a compelling explanation for the apparent scarcity of dust substructures in the younger disks at ~ 1 mm, despite mounting evidence for early planet formation (ABRIDGED).
#### On the origin of ~ 100 TeV neutrinos from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of TeV-PeV neutrinos detected by IceCube remains largely unknown. The most significant individual neutrino source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 at 4.2$\sigma$ level with a soft spectral index. Another notable candidate is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, which has been recently proposed as a potential neutrino emitter. The likelihood fit of the IceCube data for this source returned a very hard spectral index of ~ 1.9 and the excess is dominated by two high-energy events, issued as two neutrino alerts IC220424A and IC230416A. The energies of the two neutrinos are estimated to be 100-200 TeV, implying a maximum proton energy > 2 PeV, significantly higher than that in NGC 1068. The lack of lower-energy neutrinos from NGC 7469 also suggests a neutrino spectrum harder than that of NGC 1068. In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT observations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade flux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV flux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the neutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons are accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the corona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and X-rays from the corona through the $p\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with energy of 100-200 TeV. In the turbulence acceleration scenario, the required maximum proton energy can be achieved with a magnetization parameter close to unity ($\sigma\sim 1$), while in the reconnection scenario, a magnetization parameter with $\sigma\sim 10$ is needed. In both scenarios, a pair dominated composition for the corona is preferred. The difference in the neutrino spectrum between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 could be due to a different magnetization despite that they belong to the same type of AGN.
#### The magnetic sensitivity of the Ca II resonance and subordinate lines in the solar atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: The polarization of the Ca II resonant doublet (H and K lines) and the subordinate infrared triplet lines are key observables for diagnosing solar chromospheric magnetism. It is thus necessary to understand the physical mechanisms that shape their Stokes profiles in magnetic environments. Methods: Using the spectral synthesis module of the HanleRT-TIC code, we study the effects of anisotropic radiation pumping with partial frequency redistribution (PRD) and J-state interference (JSI) in a plane-parallel semi-empirical static solar atmospheric model. We also analyze the sensitivity of these lines to magnetic fields of varying strengths and orientations, accounting for the combined action of the Hanle and Zeeman effects. Results: Including PRD is crucial to model the polarization in the core regions of the resonant lines, while JSI strongly affects their far wings. The metastable lower levels of the subordinate lines also influence the scattering polarization of the K line. With horizontal magnetic fields, the resonant lines respond to field strengths from sub-gauss to tens of gauss, whereas the infrared triplet scattering polarization is mainly sensitive to milligauss fields. At a near-limb line of sight (LOS) with $\mu = 0.1$, the Hanle effect modifies the scattering polarization via a depolarization and a rotation in the plane of linear polarization. At disk center, horizontal fields generate linear polarization in the 1D model: for the K line, the Hanle effect dominates from sub-gauss to a few tens of gauss, and the Zeeman effect dominates in stronger fields. For vertical fields, the Hanle effect vanishes, but magneto-optical effects affect the linear polarization wings. Finally, atomic level polarization impacts the outer circular polarization lobes of the resonant lines, and the weak-field approximation overestimates the LOS magnetic component in this frequency range.

 We present an analysis of neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and instabilities in a rotating magnetoplasma with weak neutrino interactions. We show, for the first time, that neutrino-driven shear Alfv{é}n and oblique magnetosonic waves can be coupled by the Coriolis force, forming new wave modes affected by this force, as well as neutrino beam and two neutrino flavor oscillations. Our work extends previous theories by demonstrating that shear Alfv{é}n waves are influenced by neutrino effects and by identifying instabilities resulting from resonant interactions with both a streaming neutrino beam and flavor oscillations. We find that the Coriolis force, as well as plasma density and magnetic field strength, have a significant impact on the profiles of the instability growth rates. Our findings may shed new light on the physical mechanisms underlying core-collapse supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the observational prospects for detecting gravitational lensing induced by cosmological matter currents, a relativistic correction to the standard scalar lensing effect arising from the motion of matter. We propose to isolate this contribution by cross-correlating the weak-lensing convergence field with a reconstructed cosmic momentum field inferred from galaxy surveys. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this reconstructed momentum field is uncorrelated with the scalar lensing signal, enabling a clean separation of the gravitomagnetic component. We then forecast the detectability of this signal for upcoming wide-field galaxy and weak-lensing surveys, showing that a statistically significant detection may be achievable under realistic observational conditions. Such a measurement would provide the first direct probe of the large-scale cosmic momentum field, offering a novel test of general relativity and Lorentz invariance on cosmological scales.

 Aims: We carried out a detailed investigation of Lithium and CNO abundances, including carbon isotope ratios, in RS CVn stars to assess the role of magnetic activity in the mixing of stellar atmospheres. Methods: We obtained high-resolution spectra at the Moletai Astronomical Observatory. Lithium abundances were determined by spectral synthesis of the 6707 A line and the CNO abundances using the C2 band heads at 5135 and 5635.5 A CN bands at 6470- 6490 A and 7980 to 8005 A, and the [O I] line at 6300 A. By fitting the 13CN band at 8004.7 A, we determined the carbon isotope this http URL. We determined the main atmospheric parameters and investigated the chemical composition of 32 RS CVn stars. Lithium abundances were determined for 13 additional stars using archival spectra. We report that *iot Gem and HD 179094 have carbon isotope ratios already affected by extra-mixing, even though they are in the evolutionary stage below the red giant branch luminosity bump. About half of the low-mass giants, for which the lithium abundance was determined, follow the first dredge-up predictions; however, other stars show reduced Lithium abundances, as predicted by thermohaline-induced mixing. The intermediate-mass stars show reduced Lithium abundances reduced, as predicted by rotation-induced mixing. Conclusions. In low-mass, chromospherically active RS CVn stars, extra-mixing of lithium and carbon isotopes may begin earlier than in normal giants. The Li-rich RS CVn giant V*OP And has large C/N and carbon isotope ratios and raises questions about the origin of its lithium enhancement.
